# In Progress: 1.30-1.32 patches review

## A humble continuation of the total overhaul: Dei Gratia

This is an unofficial update of the mod Dei Gratia, originally created by Nguyen.
All credit for the original concept, design, and development goes to the original creators — this project continues their legacy with permission to maintain and adapt it for EU4 version 1.37.

The mod is currently under active updating and internal testing, so compatibility and gameplay stability are not guaranteed yet.

## Notes
- ⚠️  Not recommended for use in active mod lists or ongoing campaigns for now. 
- ⚠️  Please subscribe only if you wish to follow development progress or assist with testing and feedback.
- ⚠️  Once stable, a proper release announcement will be made.
