# Dei Gratia (UNOFFICIAL 1.37 UPDATE)
- In Progress: 1.30-1.32 patches review
- A humble continuation of the total overhaul: Dei Gratia

This is an unofficial update of the mod [Dei Gratia](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2710818802), originally created by [Nguyen](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067110437).
All credit for the original concept, design, and development goes to the original creators — this project continues their legacy with permission to maintain and adapt it for EU4 version 1.37.

The mod is currently under active updating and internal testing, so compatibility and gameplay stability are not guaranteed yet.

# What Is It?

- Total overhaul mod that rebalances development, corruption, population mechanics, and more.
- Preserves the original concept and design—no radical reboot—while updating behind-the-scenes logic.
- Designed for players who enjoy realism, slow progression, and immersive challenges.
