   - Forming Prussia as the Teutonic Order before completing "Defeat Poland" will now automatically complete the mission and select for you the Prussian Path.
   - The Russian mission "The Fate of the Peasantry" is no longer blocked if the player goes a weird path of crushing the peasants just to liberate them later on anyway.
