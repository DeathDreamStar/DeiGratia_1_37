 ipeQAR.1.t: "Pirbudag's Ambition"
 ipeQAR.1.d: "Pirbudag, the son of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, has chafed at the rule of his father, wanting even greater power and autonomy for himself. As a result, unless Pirbudag is given a position of power somewhere within the realm of the Qara Qoyunlu, it is inevitable that he will lead a revolt against $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. To alleviate this threat, we could offer Pirbudag the rulership of the city of Baghdad."
 ipeQAR.1.a: "Allow Pirbudag to rule in Baghdad."
 ipeQAR.1.b: "I will not tolerate insolent children."
 ipeQAR.2.t: "The Armies of Uzun Hasan"
 ipeQAR.2.d: "The heir to the leadership of the Aq Qoynulu, Uzun Hasan, has expressed his willingness to lead the armies, hoping to curb all our potential enemies, including the Ottomans to our west and the Qara Qoyunlu to our east. Should he be allowed to serve, Uzun Hasan would be an extremely gifted general, but we would nonetheless risk his life on the ravages of the battlefield."
 ipeQAR.2.a: "Allow Uzun Hasan to lead the armies."
 ipeQAR.2.b: "There is no need for him to endanger himself."
 ipeQAR.3.t: "Pirbudag Claims the Throne!"
 ipeQAR.3.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s son Pirbudag, who had been discontented with his father's authority and was thus given authority over Baghdad, is now allegedly looking to depose $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ as ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu! Already, Pirbudag is looking for supporters from far and wide to back his planned revolt, and if he is not dealt with in a timely manner, there could be dire consequences."
 ipeQAR.3.a: "The audacity!"
 ipeQAR.3.a.tooltip: "Pirbudag will claim all the lands of the Qara Qoyunlu."
 ipeQAR.4.t: "The Arrival of Pirbudag"
 ipeQAR.4.d: "[QAR.Monarch.GetName] of the Qara Qoyunlu has deposed the governor of Baghdad and established his son Pirbudag as the new ruler of the city, allegedly because Pirbudag has become too unruly and difficult to handle. By leaving Pirbudag to his own devices in Baghdad, [QAR.Monarch.GetName] hopes that he can be rid of the trouble that Pirbudag has threatened to bring to [QAR.Capital.GetName]."
 ipeQAR.4.a: "He is not welcome here."
 ipeQAR.5.d: "After having taken over the city of Baghdad, Pirbudag now plots to seize the throne of the Qara Qoyunlu for himself. His machinations are finally in the open, and Pirbudag has now laid claim to being the true leader of the Qara Qoyunlu, and he now searches for allies far and wide who will back his claim. At long last, we have an opportunity to subsume the Qara Qoyunlu government at [QAR.Capital.GetName]."
 ipeQAR.5.a: "We will pursue Pirbudag's ambition!"
 ipeQAR.6.t: "Death of Shah Rukh"
 ipeQAR.6.d: "The Qara Qoyunlu have long been plagued by struggles for the succession. In 1438, Shah Rukh invaded the lands of the Qara Qoyunlu and overthrew $MONARCHTITLE$ Qara Iskander, putting his brother Jahân Shah in his place. Thankful for Shah Rukh's aid, Jahân agreed to loyally serve as his vassal. However, now that Shah Rukh has passed, we are no longer bound at all to the decaying Timurid Empire.\n\nThe great chaos of Shah Rukh's succession brings opportunity. Never before has it been so feasible to invade and claim the rich lands of Persia for ourselves."
 ipeQAR.6.a: "Timur's legacy belongs to us!"
