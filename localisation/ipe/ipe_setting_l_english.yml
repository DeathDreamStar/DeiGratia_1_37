 ipe_setting.1.d: "Welcome to the §YDei Gratia (Unofficial 1.37 Update)§!.\nThis setup event allows you to tailor your experience for the most stable and enjoyable gameplay.\n\nThe §G'Recommended Mode'§! offers the intended balance and features for most players — ideal if you're experiencing Dei Gratia for the first time.\nIf your game performance struggles with additional events or modifiers, you may prefer the §T'Performance Mode'§!, which limits background scripts for smoother play.\nAlternatively, you can manually configure each gameplay option to suit your preferences. Each choice will provide a brief explanation of its effects.\n\nFor those who prefer the original experience, §B'Vanilla Mode'§! disables all Dei Gratia–specific mechanics and reverts to a more classic gameplay style.\n\nThank you for keeping this classic mod alive — and all credit goes to §YNguyen§! and Dei Gratia Mod team for the original masterpiece."

 endemic_corruption: "Endemic Corruption increases naturally as a country grows in size. Larger realms accumulate administrative inefficiency, raising corruption over time unless countered by strong governance and reform"

This preserves imperial dignity and internal harmony, but limits diplomatic flexibility and external influence."
