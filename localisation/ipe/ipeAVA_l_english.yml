 ipeAVA.1.t: "The Viceroys of Prome"
 ipeAVA.1.d: "Prome has long been an important borderland region between Ava and its most hated rival, the Hanthawaddy Kingdom of Pegu. For decades, the Kings of Ava have appointed the most senior princes of their dynasty to serve as Viceroys of Prome, respecting its strategic importance. As such, many Kings of Ava were also once Viceroys of Prome.\n\nHowever, Ava’s grip on Prome has begun to loosen, to the point that the current Viceroy of Prome, Thado Minsaw, is beginning to become a semi-independent ruler in his own right, conducting diplomacy with our vassal princes and foreign powers to maintain Prome’s prosperity, even at our own expense. Should this trend continue, we will no longer be able to appoint our own Viceroys to rule Prome, and will have to regard the city as a state in its own right."
 ipeAVA.1.a: "Allow the Viceroys of Prome to go free."
 ipeAVA.1.b: "Prome is a part of Ava!"
