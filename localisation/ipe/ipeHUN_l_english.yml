 ipeHUN.1.t: "The Fall of Hungary"
 ipeHUN.1.d: "For many years, Hungary has been the strongest rival of the Ottoman Empire in Europe, checking the Turkish advance into the Balkans and serving as the bulwark of Christendom. However, the recent Ottoman capture of [HUN.Capital.GetName] has at long last brought Hungarian resistance to an end, initiating a political collapse within Hungary. Nobles from the region of Transylvania are no longer loyal to Hungary itself, and have begun to align with the Ottoman Empire. One of them, János Zápolya, has laid claim to the entirety of Hungary itself, swiftly taking control of the eastern half of the nation. With Hungary collapsing because of both internal and external forces, the future of Europe is very much uncertain."
 ipeHUN.1.a: "We have overcome the bulwark of Europe."
 ipeHUN.1.a.tooltip: "§YAll of Eastern Hungary will become a core of and ceded to Transylvania. Transylvania will gain permanent claims on the remainder of Hungary, while becoming a March of the Ottomans. Austria may come to the aid of Hungary.§!"
 ipeHUN.2.a: "We will conquer Hungary!"
 ipeHUN.2.b: "We are doomed!"
 ipeHUN.3.t: "The Fate of Hungary"
 ipeHUN.3.d: "The collapse of Hungary to the Ottoman invasion and the rebellion of Transylvania under János Zápolya has caused a national crisis in Hungary. The nobles of the country know well that they cannot maintain the independence of the country alone, and that Hungary requires foreign aid if it should ever hope to hold off the might of the Ottomans. As a result, they now proposition that the Austrians should rule over Hungary, in hopes that Austrian forces will be enough to slow the Ottoman advance and liberate Transylvania."
 ipeHUN.3.a: "We must receive the help of Austria."

 ipeHUN.4.t: "The Austro-Hungarian Union"
 ipeHUN.4.d: "In the wake of the collapse of Hungary to the Ottoman invasion and the rebellion of Transylvania under János Zápolya, we have received news from Hungary that its nobles have decided to elect $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to the Hungarian throne, hoping that we will be capable of aiding them in resisting the Ottoman menace. If the Ottoman rampage across Eastern Europe is to come to an end, we must have a hand in stopping it."
 ipeHUN.4.a: "It will soon be time for a great confrontation."
 ipeHUN.5.t: "Hungary Rejects Union with Austria!"
 ipeHUN.5.d: "In spite of the destructive Ottoman campaign across Hungary, which saw Transylvania revolt under the rule of János Zápolya, we have received news from Hungary that its nobles have refused to elect $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to the Hungarian throne. For whatever reason, they do not believe that our aid is necessary for securing the defense of the country against the Ottoman menace. We know full well that if the Hungarians choose to proceed without our help, all their country will be lost. As such, we will have to secure the Kingdom of Hungary for the good of Christendom."
 ipeHUN.5.a: "The Hungarian throne will be ours!"
 ipeHUN.10.t: "Czech Mercenaries"
 ipeHUN.10.d: "The Czech mercenary Jan Jiskra has long been the most powerful and vehement supporter of Ladislaus Postumus in Hungary. Although the Habsburgs do not necessarily agree with his Hussite faith, they do not disagree with his tactics, which are reminiscent of those from the Hussite Wars. Marching through the lands of Upper Hungary, Jan Jiskra captured the prominent mining towns of the region and cut off communications between Hungary and Poland, becoming a thorn in the side of the late King Wladyslaw III.\n\nSince then, Jan Jiskra has proclaimed himself the Lord of Upper Hungary, holding power rivaling that of even Hungary’s mightiest feudal nobles. His Czech warbands remain an unruly threat throughout the region, pillaging the Hungarian countryside and wreaking general havoc. As a result, the Diet of Hungary now maintains that $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ should pursue war against Jan Jiskra’s mercenaries, and drive the Czechs out of Hungary once and for all."
 ipeHUN.10.a: "Drive the Czechs out of Hungary!"
 ipeHUN.10.b: "Ignore them."
 ipeHUN.11.d: "The Czech mercenary Jan Jiskra has long been the most powerful and vehement supporter of Ladislaus Postumus in Hungary. Although the Habsburgs do not necessarily agree with his Hussite faith, they do not disagree with his tactics, which are reminiscent of those from the Hussite Wars. Marching through the lands of Upper Hungary, Jan Jiskra captured the prominent mining towns of the region and cut off communications between Hungary and Poland, becoming a thorn in the side of the late King Wladyslaw III.\n\nSince then, Jan Jiskra has proclaimed himself the Lord of Upper Hungary, holding power rivaling that of even Hungary’s mightiest feudal nobles. However, our Czech warbands remain an unruly threat throughout the region, continually pillaging the Hungarian countryside and wreaking general havoc. As a result, the Diet of Hungary now maintains that it is their duty to drive us from Hungary once and for all."
 ipeHUN.11.a: "We will fend them off!"
 ipeHUN.12.t: "The Reclamation of Upper Hungary"
 ipeHUN.12.d: "The Diet of Hungary, angered by Czech mercenaries’ continual raids on the Hungarian countryside, has voted to convict [UHN.Monarch.GetName], the Lord of Upper Hungary. We have swiftly seized [UHN.Monarch.GetName]’s properties, and [UHN.Monarch.GetName] has appeared to have left the country. What shall we do with these territories?"
 ipeHUN.12.a: "Reincorporate the lands into Hungary."
 ipeHUN.12.b: "Grant them to the Count of Cilli."

 ipeHUN.13.d: "The Diet of Hungary, angered by Czech mercenaries’ continual raids on the Hungarian countryside, has voted to convict [UHN.Monarch.GetName], the Lord of Upper Hungary. They swiftly seized the mining towns of Upper Hungary, and decided by vote to grant them to us, the $MONARCHTITLE$s of Cilli. This will only increase our influence within Hungary."
 ipeHUN.13.a: "We are grateful."
 hussite_warbands: "Hussite Warbands"
 desc_hussite_warbands: "Jan Jiskra's Hussite mercenaries are an extremely effective fighting force, having carved him a personal fiefdom out of Upper Hungary. However, they are also rather disobedient, and frequently go on raids throughout the Hungarian countryside."

 desc_mining_towns_of_upper_hungary: "This province contains one of the wealthy mining towns of Upper Hungary, which are known for extracting precious metals and minerals such as copper, silver, gold, iron, and salt, generating enough revenue to support an empire."
 ipeHUN.14.t: "The Defense of Bosnia"
 ipeHUN.14.d: "In the aftermath of Christian failures such as that at the Crusade of Varna, the Ottomans have become an ever greater threat looming over the whole of southeastern Europe. Recently, the Ottomans finally have reached the borders of Bosnia, threatening the peace in our country. Recognizing the increasing danger of the Ottoman threat, [From.Monarch.GetName] of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered to protect our country in exchange for the vassalage of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]. Although this would severely limit our sovereignty, it is possibly better that we accept the overlordship of a Christian monarch than that of a heathen."
 ipeHUN.14.a: "We shall join forces with Hungary."
 ipeHUN.14.b: "Joining Hungary? Preposterous!"
 ipeHUN.15.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Becomes a Vassal of $COUNTRY$!"
 ipeHUN.15.d: "The lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$, fearful of the prospect of further Ottoman expansion into their territories, have readily accepted our offer of vassalage and protection. We will need all the help we can get to slow or even reverse the increasing Ottoman domination of the Balkans."
 ipeHUN.15.a: "We are grateful for their aid."
 ipeHUN.16.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Help Us!"
 ipeHUN.16.d: "The lords of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have vehemently rejected cooperation with us as vassals, stating that any foreign domination over their country is unacceptable. Although this may be a valid opinion, the Bosnians will likely lose their freedoms and their lives if they stand alone against the Ottoman advance."
 ipeHUN.16.a: "They will side with us, one way or another."
