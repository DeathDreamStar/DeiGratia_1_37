 ipePOR.1.t: "Wine in Madeira"
 ipePOR.1.d: "Although Madeira was once one of the world's largest producers of sugar, expansion of global commerce has shrunk Madeira's role in the global market for sweet flavorings. However, the people of Madeira have now found it increasingly profitable to produce wine, which is just as eagerly consumed by the peoples of continental Europe, who remark with effusive positivity upon the high quality of Madeira wine. It appears that even in the absence of sugar plantations, Madeira will still be able to economically prosper."
 ipePOR.1.a: "Wonderful."
 plantations_of_madeira: "Plantations of Madeira"
 desc_plantations_of_madeira: "The sugar plantations of Madeira are among the most productive in the entire world, yielding an extremely large portion of the European supply of sugar. Until new locations for sugar cultivation are acquired elsewhere, Madeira will continue to serve as a tremendous boon to the Portuguese economy."

 desc_artilharia: "We have established the role of Vedor-Mor da Artilharia, or Superintendent of the Artillery. The Kings of Portugal acknowledge and understand the importance of artillery to the fighting capability of the Portuguese army. Thanks to our efforts, Portugal will have one of the world's most advanced artillery contingents."
 ipePOR.2.t: "Afonsine Ordinances"
 ipePOR.2.d: "The growth of aristocratic privilege has long threatened the concentration of royal power in Portugal. Numerous noblemen of substantial power and influence, including the Duke of Braganza, who owns perhaps a third of all land in the Kingdom, consistently exercise their power to profit at the expense of the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\nThe continued success of the Portuguese state demands that we bring the upstart nobles of Portugal to heel. By issuing the Afonsine Ordinances, we can perhaps hope to place much-needed limits upon their influence."
 ipePOR.2.a: "Institute the Afonsine Ordinances."
 ipePOR.2.b: "We do not wish to anger the nobility."
 ipePOR.3.t: "Joanna la Beltraneja"
 ipePOR.3.d: "The designation of Isabella de Trastámara as heir to the Castilian throne has led to the disinheritance of her half-niece Joanna, who is purported to be the daughter of the Castilian [CAS.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, her parentage has always been in doubt, leading other nobles to derisively call her \"la Beltraneja,\" the bastard.\n\nBut in spite of her questionable parentage, some nobles continue to support Joanna and her claim to the Castilian throne, hoping to increase their own power at the expense of the monarchy. As such, the question of Joanna’s future presents a unique opportunity for $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who has long been vying to assert Portuguese influence across Iberia. By taking Joanna’s hand in marriage, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ could claim the title of [CAS.Monarch.GetTitle] in his own right, bringing about a new union to Iberia."
 ipePOR.3.a: "Marry Joana."
 ipePOR.3.a.tooltip: "§YMarrying Joanna will lead to a succession crisis in Castile as soon as Isabella takes power. If this happens, a civil war will begin in Castile, giving us the opportunity to seize control of the whole of the Kingdom.§!"
 ipePOR.3.b: "We should not interfere with Castilian affairs."
 ipePOR.4.t: "Ending the Castilian Civil War"
 ipePOR.4.d: "For many years now, we have been locked into a stalemate against the Kingdom of Castile. Neither side has managed to gain an edge in the Castilian Civil War, while the Castilian nobility grows discontented with the state of affairs. Perhaps it is time to abandon our claim to the throne of Castile."
 ipePOR.4.a: "It is time to lay down our arms."
 ipePOR.4.b: "No! We must keep fighting!"
 ipePOR.5.d: "For many years now, we have been locked into a stalemate against the Kingdom of Portugal. Neither side has managed to gain an edge in the Castilian Civil War, while the Castilian nobility grows discontented with the state of affairs. Amid their inability to achieve decisive victory, the Portuguese have decided to abandon Castile, leaving us the final victors of this conflict."
 ipePOR.5.a: "We welcome the arrival of peace."
 ipePOR.6.t: "The Foundation of Porto Seguro"
 ipePOR.6.d: "Our explorers have landed at the site of Porto Seguro on the coast of Brazil, making way for the establishment of a new settlement. While the natives are still not sure what to make of our arrival, we hope to capitalize on the opportunity to turn Brazil into a major colony of the Portuguese Empire."
 ipePOR.6.a: "It will be a wealthy and prosperous land."
 ipePOR.7.d: "Settlers from a faraway country have arrived on the eastern coast, establishing a settlement that they now call Porto Seguro. These settlers call themselves the Portuguese, and say that they hope to somehow grow rich by cultivating this land."
 ipePOR.7.a: "We shall see whether we can be friends."
 ipePOR.8.t: "The Portuguese Interest in Malabar"
 ipePOR.8.d: "Kochin has long been a fierce rival of Calicut, the most powerful kingdom of the Malabar Coast. The Zamorin of Calicut has threatened the independence of Kochin on more than one occasion, and as such we have constantly looked to foreign allies who might help us maintain our independence.\n\nExplorers from a faraway land have recently arrived on the shores of Kochi. They speak a language different from that of the Asian and African traders who typically visit the port, and claim to hail from a distant nation known as Portugal. Although these explorers are few in number, they are militarily formidable, sailing on warships armed with the finest of cannons. These strangers have offered to protect Kochi, in return for safe harbor and the protection of their trade interests. We are unsure whether to trust these newcomers."
 ipePOR.8.a: "We should accept Portuguese protection."
 accepted_protection: "Accepted Protection"
 ipePOR.8.b: "Allowing Europeans to control our affairs? Preposterous!"
 refused_protection: "Refused Protection"
 ipePOR.9.t: "Kochin Accepts Protection!"
 ipePOR.9.d: "The ruler of the faraway city of Kochin has agreed to become a vassal of the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, accepting our offer to protect Kochin from the Zamorin of Calicut and other dangerous enemies. As a result, we now can find safe harbor in Kochin, where our merchants and sailors will find themselves welcome. It is a major step toward expanding our foothold on the Indian subcontinent."
 ipePOR.9.a: "They are wise to side with us."
 ipePOR.10.t: "Kochin Refuses Protection!"
 ipePOR.10.d: "The haughty ruler of the faraway city of Kochin has refused our offer to make the city a protectorate of $COUNTRY$. Evidently, the ruler of Kochin does not feel that rivals such as the Zamorin of Calicut are threatening enough to require that Kochin seek foreign allies. The resistance of Kochin will make it difficult for us to expand our foothold on the Indian subcontinent."
 ipePOR.10.a: "Kochin will surely fall without our aid."
 ipePOR.11.t: "The Betrayal of Kochin"
 ipePOR.11.d: "The city of Kochin has long been subject to the influence of our empire, but it seems that time has come to an end. Kochin has accepted the protection of a faraway nation, whose people are reportedly armed with the finest of gunpowder weapons. The ruler of Kochin hopes that this diplomatic maneuvering will better protect the city from the likes of dangerous enemies, including the Zamorin of Calicut."
 ipePOR.11.a: "Very well."
 ipePOR.12.t: "The Conquest of Goa"
 ipePOR.12.d: "Explorers from $FROMCOUNTRY$, who have allegedly come to India for the purpose of trade, have committed a great crime against us by besieging and capturing the city of Goa. With the aid of a local privateer known as Timoji, $FROMCOUNTRY$’s forces have seized the settlement and constructed new fortifications at the site. This may only be the beginning of our quarrels with these new arrivals in India."
 ipePOR.12.a: "They will pay for this!"
 conquered_goa: "Conquered Goa"
 ipe_flavor_por.11.t: "The Conquest of Goa"
 ipe_flavor_por.11.d: "Rarely is an empire ever born from peace. While the states of India are extremely powerful, they are no match for the technological prowess of $COUNTRY$.  With the help of a local privateer known as Timoji, our forces have conquered the city of Goa on the western coast of India, and established fortifications there. It will be the center of our burgeoning empire in the great subcontinent of India."
 ipePOR.13.t: "The Portuguese in Gujarat"
 ipePOR.13.d: "The Portuguese have been attempting to exert their influence over the coast of India for some time now, hoping to enrich themselves through trade. In the time since they conquered Goa, the Portuguese have been looking to expand their territorial foothold, and recently have ventured to the coasts of Gujarat in order to seek further opportunities. The Portuguese are now offering to pay $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ an exorbitant sum of money in return for gaining control of several minor towns and settlements along the coast, which they plan to make into their Northern Province ruled from Goa."
 ipePOR.13.a: "We need the money."
 ipePOR.13.b: "This is a ridiculous proposal!"
 refused_to_sell: "Refused to Sell"
 ipePOR.14.t: "The Northern Province"
 ipePOR.14.d: "Ever since we conquered the city of Goa, we have been looking to further expand our territorial foothold along the coast of India. We found one such opportunity to do so in Gujarat, offering the [GUJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of that country an exorbitant sum to take control of several small coastal settlements. Ultimately, the [GUJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of Gujarat has accepted our offer, taking our money in return for ceding sovereignty over the areas in question."
 ipePOR.14.a: "Excellent!"
 ipePOR.15.t: "The Gujarati Refusal"
 ipePOR.15.d: "Ever since we conquered the city of Goa, we have been looking to further expand our territorial foothold along the coast of India. We found one such opportunity to do so in Gujarat, offering the [GUJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of that country an exorbitant sum to take control of several small coastal settlements. However, the [GUJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of Gujarat has refused our offer, stating that no sum of money would ever be adequate compensation for such a loss of land."
 ipePOR.15.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipePOR.16.t: "The Sofala Expedition"
 ipePOR.16.d: "Among the diverse visitors to the powerful trading city of Sofala, there are new arrivals. Previously disguising themselves as Arab merchants, a group of Christian explorers and merchants have now revealed themselves to us as the Portuguese, hailing from a faraway kingdom thousands of leagues across the ocean. The Portuguese have come to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ offering treaties of commerce and protection, if we would only allow them build and occupy a fort near Sofala to secure their regional interests. These newcomers appear to wield advanced gunpowder weapons, which we might be able to use to overcome the likes of our rivals."
 ipePOR.16.a: "By all means, let them come!"
 ipePOR.16.b: "Permitting Europeans to stay would be dangerous."
 ipePOR.17.t: "Sofala Accepts Protection!"
 ipePOR.17.d: "Previously, we sent expeditions to explore the eastern coast of Africa. Unsure of how the natives of the region would regard foreigners such as us, our explorers often disguised themselves as Arab merchants. However, we have finally come to the major gold emporium of Sofala in force, and revealed our presence to the [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] of that city. We have offered [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] [SFA.Monarch.GetName] a treaty by which we would be permitted to construct a fort outside the city in return for providing Sofala with protection against foreign enemies. Fortunately for us, the [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] has accepted the treaty, making Sofala a new outpost of our empire."
 ipePOR.18.t: "Sofala Refuses Protection!"
 ipePOR.18.d: "Previously, we sent expeditions to explore the eastern coast of Africa. Unsure of how the natives of the region would regard foreigners such as us, our explorers often disguised themselves as Arab merchants. However, we have finally come to the major gold emporium of Sofala in force, and revealed our presence to the [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] of that city. We have offered [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] [SFA.Monarch.GetName] a treaty by which we would be permitted to construct a fort outside the city in return for providing Sofala with protection against foreign enemies. Unfortunately for us, the [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] has refused to accept the treaty, meaning that we will be forced to seize control of Sofala through military means."
 ipePOR.18.a: "Sofala's future is in jeopardy without us."
 ipePOR.19.t: "The Betrayal of Sofala"
 ipePOR.19.d: "Sofala, the primary emporium for the gold trade in East Africa, has long been subject to our suzerainty. However, the era of our domination over that city has finally come to an end, as the [SFA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Sofala has pledged allegiance to a new power, the Portuguese. These interlopers will certainly continue to expand at our own expense, and threaten the very security of our rule in East Africa. If the Portuguese are not stopped, they may one day monopolize the Indian Ocean trade altogether."
 ipePOR.20.t: "The Portuguese in Malindi"
 ipePOR.20.d: "New arrivals have appeared in the harbor of Malindi, one of the most prosperous towns on the Swahili Coast. They claim to be the Portuguese, Christian explorers and merchants from a faraway land. Although we know little about them, it is evident that they are rather formidable, as they wield advanced gunpowder weapons even better than our own.\n\nWhile we have long been subject to the suzerainty of the Sultanate of Kilwa, the [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered to protect Malindi and make $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ a vassal. Acquiring the patronage of a new overlord could grant us many new commercial opportunities."
 ipePOR.20.a: "They will make excellent allies."
 ipePOR.20.b: "The Portuguese shall not rule Malindi."
 ipePOR.21.t: "Malindi Accepts Protection!"
 ipePOR.21.d: "Malindi is one of the most prosperous towns on the Swahili Coast, and among the friendliest to our explorers and merchants. The city prospers thanks to its trade in lucrative goods such as ivory, coconuts, oranges, millet, and rice. We have offered the [MLI.Monarch.GetTitle] of Malindi protection under the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, in return for the right to construct a trading post in the city. Fortunately, the [MLI.Monarch.GetTitle] has accepted our offer, hoping that our patronage will provide Malindi with an edge over its rivals. Thus, we have gained one of our first footholds on the eastern coast of Africa."
 ipePOR.21.a: "It is a valuable possession."
 ipePOR.22.t: "Malindi Refuses Protection!"
 ipePOR.22.d: "Malindi is one of the most prosperous towns on the Swahili Coast, and among the friendliest to our explorers and merchants. The city prospers thanks to its trade in lucrative goods such as ivory, coconuts, oranges, millet, and rice. We have offered the [MLI.Monarch.GetTitle] of Malindi protection under the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, in return for the right to construct a trading post in the city. But much to our dismay, the [MLI.Monarch.GetTitle] has refused our offer, fearing the loss of Malindi’s independence under our rule. Thus, we will have to gain control of Malindi by force."
 ipePOR.22.a: "Malindi will be rapidly eclipsed without us."
 ipePOR.23.t: "The Betrayal of Malindi"
 ipePOR.23.d: "Malindi is a settlement on the Swahili Coast that has been subject to our overlordship for some time. The city prospers thanks to its trade in lucrative goods such as ivory, coconuts, oranges, millet, and rice. In recent times, our influence over Malindi has waned, to the point that new arrivals to the city, the Portuguese, have already signed a trade treaty with the [MLI.Monarch.GetTitle] of Malindi, making Malindi a protectorate of their empire and removing it from our control. It will be very difficult to win back control of Malindi."
 ipePOR.24.d: "Alongside ports such as Calicut, Kochin, and Quilon, Cannanore has long been one of the most important commrecial ports on the Malabar Coast. Recently, we have been greeted by new arrivals from a faraway land - the Portuguese. They are Christians, and heavily armed with the most modern of gunpowder weapons. But while the Portuguese are clearly a force to be reckoned with, they claim to have arrived in our humble port with peaceful intentions, hoping to find new trading opportunities. As such, the Portuguese have offered a treaty to the $MONARCHTITLE$, suggesting that we become a protectorate of their country so that our mutual economic interests may be secured."
 ipePOR.25.t: "Kolathunad Accepts Protection!"
 ipePOR.25.d: "Alongside ports such as Calicut, Kochin, and Quilon, Cannanore has long been one of the most important commrecial ports on the Malabar Coast. Recently, our explorers and merchants have reached Cannanore, and offered the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] a treaty through which Cannanore would become a protectorate of $COUNTRY$, in return for our right to build a factory in the city. Fortunately, the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] has accepted our offer, eager to expand the city’s commercial influence and secure Cannanore’s position against its rivals."
 ipePOR.26.t: "Kolathunad Refuses Protection!"
 ipePOR.26.d: "Alongside ports such as Calicut, Kochin, and Quilon, Cannanore has long been one of the most important commrecial ports on the Malabar Coast. Recently, our explorers and merchants have reached Cannanore, and offered the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] a treaty through which Cannanore would become a protectorate of $COUNTRY$, in return for our right to build a factory in the city. Unfortunately, the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] has refused our offer, afraid of $COUNTRY$ gaining too much influence over the city."
 ipePOR.26.a: "Kolathunad will surely decline without our aid."
 ipePOR.27.t: "The Betrayal of Kolathunad"
 ipePOR.27.d: "Much to our dismay, the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] of Cannanore, one of the major ports on the Malabar Coast, has accepted the overlordship of a foreign power, Portugal. The Portuguese have offered the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] lucrative trade opportunities and protection against regional rivals. If we are to establish supremacy over the Malabar Coast, we must punish the [KLT.Monarch.GetTitle] for daring to drift away from our influence."
 ipePOR.28.d: "Quilon is one of the oldest and most important trading ports in India, serving as the center of Venad. As such, it has quickly come to the attention of new arrivals, the Portuguese, who have visited several ports along the Malabar Coast. Now, the Portuguese have offered our $MONARCHTITLE$ a commercial treaty, which would make Venad a protectorate of Portugal in return for allowing the Portuguese to construct a factory in the city. While this could be economically beneficial for us, there is danger in surrendering our independence to such a faraway and unknown power."
 ipePOR.29.t: "Venad Accepts Protection!"
 ipePOR.29.d: "Quilon is one of the oldest and most important trading ports in India, serving as the center of Venad. As such, it quickly come to the attention of our explorers and merchants, who have visited several ports along the Malabar Coast. We have offered the [VND.Monarch.GetTitle] of Venad a commercial treaty, which would make Venad a protectorate of $COUNTRY$ in return for allowing us to construct a factory in the city. Luckily for us, the [VND.Monarch.GetTitle] has accepted our offer, hoping to economically benefit from such an arrangement."
 ipePOR.30.t: "Venad Refuses Protection!"
 ipePOR.30.d: "Quilon is one of the oldest and most important trading ports in India, serving as the center of Venad. As such, it quickly come to the attention of our explorers and merchants, who have visited several ports along the Malabar Coast. We have offered the [VND.Monarch.GetTitle] of Venad a commercial treaty, which would make Venad a protectorate of $COUNTRY$ in return for allowing us to construct a factory in the city. Unluckily for us, the [VND.Monarch.GetTitle] has refused our offer, being unwilling to subject Venad to the influence of such a faraway and unknown power."
 ipePOR.30.a: "Venad will surely suffer without us."
 ipePOR.31.t: "The Betrayal of Venad"
 ipePOR.31.d: "It is no secret that the influence of $COUNTRY$ over the Malabar Coast is rapidly declining. The arrival of the Portuguese in that region has not bode well for our authority, as they offered a commercial treaty to the [VND.Monarch.GetTitle] of Venad, making that country a protectorate of Portugal in return for the right to build a factory in Quilon. We will be hard-pressed to drive the Portuguese from that city and restore our suzerainty over Venad."
 ipePOR.32.t: "The Portuguese in Pulicat"
 ipePOR.32.d: "Portuguese merchants have begun to venture increasingly far distances across the Indian Ocean, now well past their main center of operations on India’s western coast. As a result, the Portuguese now seek to control new ports on the opposite side of India. One desirable port they have found is the town of Pulicat, which is currently under our possession. The Portuguese have offered to purchase Pulicat from us for a substantial sum, which would help fill our coffers."
 ipePOR.32.a: "Sell the town to Portugal."
 ipePOR.32.b: "We cannot sacrifice our territorial integrity!"
 ipePOR.33.t: "The Sale of Pulicat"
 ipePOR.33.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to sell the port of Pulicat to us for a substantial sum of money, granting us control of a new base on the eastern coast of India. This will help our merchants and explorers further expand their reach into the distant lands of Asia, and create many new commercial opportunities for us."
 ipePOR.33.a: "An excellent addition to our empire."
 ipePOR.34.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Sell Pulicat!"
 ipePOR.34.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused to sell the port of Pulicat to us, denying us the opportunity to control a new base on the eastern coast of India. This will make it difficult for our merchants and explorers to further expand their reach into the distant lands of Asia, and we will have to look elsewhere to find new commercial opportunities."
 ipePOR.34.a: "A missed opportunity."
 ipePOR.35.t: "The Portuguese in Chittagong"
 ipePOR.35.d: "Chittagong is a major shipbuilding and commercial hub of $COUNTRY$, having been heavily influenced by Arab and Persian merchants who converted the inhabitants to Islam. Recently, it has been visited by Portuguese explorers, who have been in search of vibrant commercial centers throughout the Far East. The Portuguese have offered to pay $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ a large sum for control of the port, hoping to expand their foothold in India. We too could benefit from the economic initiatives of the Portuguese."
 ipePOR.35.a: "Allow the Portuguese to settle in Chittagong."
 ipePOR.35.b: "Kick the Portuguese out!"
 ipePOR.36.t: "The Sale of Chittagong"
 ipePOR.36.d: "Chittagong is a major shipbuilding and commercial hub of $COUNTRY$, having been heavily influenced by Arab and Persian merchants who converted the inhabitants to Islam. It is perhaps one of the oldest ports in the world, having even appeared on the ancient maps of Ptolemy. Recently, it has been visited by our explorers, who have been in search of vibrant commercial centers throughout the Far East. We offered to pay [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] a large sum for control of the port, hoping to expand our foothold in India. Serendipitously, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has accepted our deal, granting us a large and prosperous port at the crossroads of India and Burma."
 ipePOR.36.a: "It will be a most useful port."
 ipePOR.37.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Sell Chittagong!"
 ipePOR.37.d: "Chittagong is a major shipbuilding and commercial hub of $COUNTRY$, having been heavily influenced by Arab and Persian merchants who converted the inhabitants to Islam.

We offered to pay [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] a large sum for control of the port, hoping to expand our foothold in India. To our dismay, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has refused our deal, stating that the port of Chittagong is far too important to hand over to a foreign power."
 ipePOR.37.a: "We will acquire more ports one way or another."
