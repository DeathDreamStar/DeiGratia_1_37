 ipeSWI.1.t: "St. Gallen Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.1.d: "In 1411, the city of St. Gallen became an ally of the Swiss Confederacy after rebelling against the ecclesiastical Abbey of St. Gallen. Furthermore, in 1415, the city purchased its freedom Sigismund of Luxembourg, the King of Germany. Since then, the city has been a valued friend of the Confederacy, led by a civic government dominated by the local guilds. Now, the citizens of St. Gallen wish to deepen their associations with the Confederacy, and we will not deny them."
 ipeSWI.1.a: "The Confederacy grows stronger."
 ipeSWI.2.t: "The Three Leagues Join the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.2.d: "The Three Leagues is an alliance of the League of God’s House, the League of the Ten Jurisdictions, and the Grey League, which together control a wide swathe of land across the Alps, with its capital at Ilanz. The alliance of the Three Leagues has served to spurn Habsburg expansion westward. In repelling Habsburg aggression, the Swiss Confederacy and the Three Leagues have a common goal, and therefore it is only natural that they join forces with us."
 ipeSWI.3.t: "Fribourg Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.3.d: "Although Fribourg was sold to the Habsburg dynasty in 1277, the city has maintained much of its independent character, forging an alliance with Bern in 1403. Fribourg has gradually expanded over time, now controlling all territory within three leagues of the city. While the Habsburgs and Savoy continue to exert a great deal of influence over the city and its affairs, the citizens are well aware now that their future is brightest should they side with the free peoples of the Swiss Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.4.t: "The Seizure of Thurgau"
 ipeSWI.4.d: "When the Kyburg dynasty went extinct in 1264, the Habsburgs inherited their lands in Switzerland, including Thurgau. The Swiss cantons have long held the ambition of conquering the province, and now have agreed to divide its administration amongst themselves. Our troops have now marched into Thurgau, and seized control of the land for the Confederacy."

 ipeSWI.5.d: "When the Kyburg dynasty went extinct in 1264, the Habsburgs inherited their lands in Switzerland, including Thurgau. The Swiss cantons have long held the ambition of conquering the province, and now have agreed to divide its administration amongst themselves. Swiss troops have crossed the border into Thurgau, occupying the territory and claiming it as land belonging to the Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.5.a: "The Confederacy has gone too far!"
 ipeSWI.6.d: "When the Kyburg dynasty went extinct in 1264, the Habsburgs inherited their lands in Switzerland, including Thurgau. The Swiss cantons have long held the ambition of conquering the province, and now have agreed to divide its administration amongst themselves. Swiss troops have crossed the border into Thurgau, occupying the territory and claiming it as land of the Confederacy.\n\nAlthough Thurgau was a Habsburg territory, it also served as the natural hinterland of the city of Konstanz. Without Thurgau, our continued development will be somewhat constrained. As a result, we should consider joining the Swiss Confederacy to regain access to these resources."
 ipeSWI.6.a: "Perhaps we should throw in our lot with the Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.6.a.tooltip: "§RIf we are allowed into the Confederacy, Konstanz will become a part of Switzerland.§!"
 ipeSWI.6.b: "We will not associate with them."
 ipeSWI.7.t: "Konstanz Petitions to Join the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.7.d: "Recently, our forces seized control of the province of Thurgau. Although Thurgau was a Habsburg territory, it also served as the natural hinterland of the city of Konstanz. Without Thurgau, the burghers of Konstanz fear that the continued development of their city will be constrained, and as a result, they have petitioned to join the Swiss Confederacy.\n\nWhile admitting Konstanz to the Confederacy would increase our manpower and expand our authority across the Rhine, some circles in the Confederacy fear that admitting an Imperial Free City would gives burghers too much influence in our affairs."
 ipeSWI.7.a: "Allow them to join the Confederacy."
 ADMITTED_KONSTANZ: "Admitted Konstanz to the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.7.b: "Reject them."
 ipeSWI.8.t: "The Swiss Refuse Admission"
 ipeSWI.8.d: "Fearing that admitting an Imperial Free City to the Swiss Confederacy would give the burghers too much influence in its affairs, the Confederacy has declined to accept us into its alliance."
 ipeSWI.8.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipeSWI.9.t: "Rottweil Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.9.d: "Rottweil has been an Imperial Free City since 1268. Although we are now associating with Rottweil under the pretense of a temporary alliance, there is great potential for Rottweil to become a major center of the Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.203.a.tooltip: "§RIf we are allowed into the Confederacy, Geneva will become a part of Switzerland.§!"
 ipeSWI.10.t: "Basel Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.10.d: "By the late 14th century, the city of Basel managed to secure de facto independence from the Prince-Bishopric of Basel. While it continues to maintain a nominal oath of fealty to the bishops, their secular influence has effectively been limited to the areas west of Basel. With the city of Basel becoming increasingly independent of its former ecclesiastical overlords, the citizens of the city see a new opportunity to join forces with the mighty Swiss Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.11.t: "Valais Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.11.d: "Valais has long been under the domination of the Dukes of Savoy, but that time has now passed. The people of Valais have agreed to join the Swiss Confederacy, giving us control over the strategic mountain passes in this particular region of the Alps, and strengthening the borders of the Confederacy."
 ipeSWI.12.t: "Mulhouse Joins the Confederacy"
 ipeSWI.12.d: "Although Mulhouse has been a part of the Décapole, an alliance of 10 Free Imperial Cities in Alsace, since 1354, the citizenry of Mulhouse now seek out other ties in order to secure the independence of their city, fearing the encroaching influence of France and Austria. Impressed by the growing strength of the Swiss Confederacy, the people of Mulhouse have petitioned to join us instead."
