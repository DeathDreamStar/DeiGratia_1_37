 ipe_economy.1.t: "$YEAR$ Eruption of Kuwae"
 ipe_economy.1.d: "In 1452, the volcano Kuwae erupted in the islands of Vanuatu, causing a volcanic winter that led to crop failures worldwide. Nonstop frosts were reported everywhere from China to Mesoamerica, leading to famines that killed countless people around the globe."
 ipe_economy.1.a: "Agricultural products will be less profitable for now."
 KUWAE: "Eruption of Kuwae"
 ipe_economy.2.t: "Commercial Whaling"
 ipe_economy.2.d: "Sailors are beginning to make regular voyages into the Arctic to practice whaling. Skilled individuals such as Basque specialists have helped bring about the advent of commercial whaling, as the continual demand for whaling goods and fierce competition between whaling fleets keeps prices high."

 ipe_economy.5.t: "Eruption of Mount Tambora"
 ipe_economy.5.d: "The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora was the most powerful volcanic eruption in recorded human history, launching 200 cubic kilometers of material into the atmosphere. The ash from the eruption column dispersed across the world, blotting out the sun and bringing about the Year Without a Summer in 1816, resulting in severe temperature drops worldwide, causing widespread crop failures. Paintings made years after the eruption showed skies reddened with volcanic tephra, with rich and vivid sunsets. Tens of thousands people died from the immediate effects of the eruption in Indonesia."

 ipe_economy.6.t: "Eruption of Laki"
 ipe_economy.6.d: "The Icelandic volcano Laki experienced a series of violent eruptions from June 1783 to February 1784, spewing 14 cubic kilometers of lava and releasing tremendous clouds of poisonous gases into the atmosphere. These effects killed more than half of the livestock in Iceland, while also destroying practically all crops. 20 Icelandic villages were also annihilated by the lava flows. One-quarter of the Icelandic population is estimated to have died in the ensuing famine.\n\nOn a global scale however, the eruption induced a volcanic winter causing worldwide crop failures. In the aftermath, one-sixth of the Egyptian population died of famine, while Japan’s Great Tenmei Famine only continued. However, perhaps most significantly of all, the worsened conditions in France likely contributed to the conditions of poverty and hunger that ultimately led to the French Revolution, which would drown the whole of Europe in war for the next three decades. The eruption of Laki would thus become one of the most consequential in all of recorded history."

 desc_curtailed_the_hansa: "In an effort to appease local merchants competing with the likes of the Hansa, we have prohibited the Hanseatic League from continuing to trade in our ports, forcing them out of our local trade."
 kontor: "Kontor"
 desc_kontor: "The Kontore are foreign trading posts of the Hanseatic League, based in various ports with representative merchants and warehouses. Each Kontor has its own treasury, court, and seal. Although the mercantile activities of the Kontor will help bring great wealth, they also draw the ire of competing local merchants."

 ipe_economy.7.d: "In 1465, one of the largest volcanic eruptions in recorded history is likely to have occurred. It was approximately as large as the later eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815, occurring in the South Pacific Ocean and distributing volcanic ash throughout the atmosphere. It is most commonly associated with the submerged caldera of Kuwae off the coast of Vanuatu, which had already induced a volcanic winter through its 1452 eruption just 13 years earlier. The 1465 eruption would likewise produce global famines and deeply harm worldwide agriculture. Anomalous weather patterns would be recorded by Asians and Europeans for several years after the eruption."

 ipe_economy.9.d: "The change in size of our country’s internal market has affected the ability of merchants to do business abroad. This will cause a shift in our influence in global trade."
