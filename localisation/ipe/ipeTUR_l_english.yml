 ipeTUR.10.t: "$YEAR$ Constantinople Earthquake"
 ipeTUR.10.d: "In the capital of Constantinople, a great calamity has taken place. A large earthquake has caused savage destruction to the city, destroying many of its buildings and killing thousands of people, even causing a tsunami to wash up on the shores of the Bosporus. It will be extremely expensive to repair the damage, but at the same time, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s life is currently at risk should he stay in the capital, as the aftershocks are continuing and may go on for several months. However, if $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ leaves the capital, other members of the Osmanoglu dynasty may see it as an opportunity for themselves to seize the throne in the $MONARCHTITLE$'s moment of weakness."
 ipeTUR.10.a: "We must leave for safety."
 ipeTUR.10.b: "I will not go!"
 ipeTUR.11.t: "Manuel Palaiologos"
 ipeTUR.11.d: "After the Fall of Constantinople, the last Byzantine Emperor’s son Manuel Palaiologos fled abroad to Rome, trying to sell his titles to the Pope in order to acquire funds large enough to maintain his personal retinue, However, the Pope continually lowballed Manuel, leading him to look elsewhere for payment.\n\nIn a move that has shocked everyone, Maneul has now returned to Constantinople, presenting himself graciously before $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, offering to renounce his rights to the former Byzantine Empire if we should pay him a large pension. Indeed, it would greatly benefit the legitimacy of our dynasty if we were to treat Manuel Palaiologos well where his supposed Christian allies did not."
 ipeTUR.11.a: "We welcome Manuel Palaiologos!"
 ipeTUR.11.b: "His wishes are irrelevant."
 ipeTUR.12.t: "Cem's Ambition"
 ipeTUR.12.d: "For many years, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s brother Cem was the favorite to succeed to the Ottoman throne. However, now that $MONARCH$ has taken power, Cem is very unhappy, and has begun to amass forces from his extensive domains in Anatolia, preparing for a march on $CAPITAL$. Unless we deal with Cem quickly, we may soon find ourselves on the brink of yet another interregnum in the Ottoman Empire."
 ipeTUR.12.a: "He will be destroyed!"
 ipeTUR.12.a.tooltip: "§RIf Cem takes control of the Ottoman capital, he will become the newest ruler of the Ottoman Empire and you will instantly lose the game. Defend the capital with your life.§!"
 ipeTUR.13.t: "Cem's Defeat"
 ipeTUR.13.d: "After a grueling conflict against the forces of Cem Osmanoglu, we have finally defeated his armies, seized the rebels’ base of power, and reimposed central authority upon Anatolia. While Cem is not dead, having fled to faraway lands in order to find safety, the empire can now at long last enjoy the respite of peace, as $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has finally secured his claim to the Ottoman throne."
 ipeTUR.13.a: "Good riddance!"
 ipeTUR.14.t: "The Ottoman Succession"
 ipeTUR.14.d: "After a grueling conflict against the forces of the Ottoman Sultan, we have finally defeated his armies, seized the Ottoman capital, and given a sure sign of our authority over the entire Empire. All opposition to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ will be executed, as there will be no toleration for any other pretender to contest $MONARCH$’s rightful claim to the throne of the Empire."
 ipeTUR.14.a: "The crown goes to those who fight for it!"
 ipeTUR.39.t: "Cem in Rhodes"
 ipeTUR.39.d: "Following a difficult and failed war of succession against his brother, Cem Osmanoglu has fled the Ottoman Empire, setting foot onto Rhodes and going into the custody of the Knights Hospitaller. Cem claims to us that if he were to take power in the Ottoman Empire, he would pursue various policies less hostile to Christians throughout his nation. Nonetheless, Cem's loyalty is questionable and we are not sure whether he can be trusted."
 ipeTUR.39.a: "Ransom him off to the Ottomans."
 ipeTUR.39.b: "Execute this traitor."
 executed_cem: "Executed Cem"
 ipeTUR.40.d: "We have now learned of the fact that Cem Osmanoglu is in the custody of the Knights Hospitaller at Rhodes. The Knights are now ransoming off Cem, threatening to free him and allow him to wreak further havoc in our country if we do not agree to the terms of the ransom. Although we are loathe to give money to the likes of the Knights Hospitaller, Cem will undoubtedly cause further destruction should he go free."
 ipeTUR.40.a: "We must pay the ransom."
 ipeTUR.40.b: "We will not negotiate with pirates!"
 ipeTUR.40.b.tooltip: "§RCem may cause further mayhem in the Ottoman Empire.§!"
 ipeTUR.41.t: "Cem's Ransom"
 ipeTUR.41.d: "Fearing that he could cause further dynastic turomil in the Ottoman Empire, the High Porte has agreed to pay a ransom for Cem, asking that we keep him imprisoned in the fortress of Rhodes. Although the Ottomans are our most hated enemies, we will abide by this deal."
 ipeTUR.41.a: "Very well."
 ipeTUR.42.d: "The Ottomans, viewing us with immense distrust, have refused to pay a ransom for us to keep Cem imprisoned at Rhodes. Seeing that we have no reason to continue keeping him in our custody, we will allow Cem to leave free. We are not to be blamed if he causes further havoc in Ottoman lands."
 ipeTUR.42.a.tooltip: "§GCem may cause further mayhem in the Ottoman Empire.§!"
 ipeTUR.43.t: "The Return of Cem"
 ipeTUR.43.d: "Previously, we defeated the armies of Cem Osmanoglu, a pretender to the throne of the Ottoman Empire. After his defeat, Cem fled to Rhodes, under the control of the Knights Hospitaller, seeking refuge from our forces. We refused to pay the Knights a ransom to keep Cem in their custody, and a result Cem continued plotting against us.\n\nAt long last, Cem has returned to the Ottoman Empire, stirring up a new rebellion and recruiting new followers for his cause. If the Empire is to remain strong, he must be crushed!"
 ipeTUR.43.a: "Death to Cem!"
 ipeTUR.44.t: "The Ottoman Throne"
 ipeTUR.44.d: "Although we have briefly experienced the lull of peace, is time that we strike the Ottoman Empire again in order to seize the throne for $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. We will return to war!"
 ipeTUR.44.a: "To arms!"
 ipeTUR.45.t: "The Pretenders Declare War!"
 ipeTUR.45.d: "The pretenders to the Ottoman throne, based in the Eyalet of Rûm, have declared war in yet another bid to seize control of the country for themselves. This time we will vanquish them once and for all!"
 ipeTUR.45.a: "They will not escape this time!"
 ipeTUR.48.t: "The Gates of Europe"
 ipeTUR.48.d: "Since the Peace of Szeged in 1444, the Despotate of Serbia has been an Ottoman vassal, pledging 4,000 cavalry at a call to arms and 50,000 florins to the Ottoman Empire. However, over time the Ottoman Empire has increasingly infringed upon the independence of Serbia, and it is no secret that [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [TUR.Monarch.GetName] has designs on the extremely productive silver mines of Novo Brdo and further conquests even deeper into Eastern Europe. The Serbian Despotate’s existence stands in the way of all these grand ambitions.\n\nNow, [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [TUR.Monarch.GetName] is demanding the dissolution of the Despotate of Serbia, and that the country be fully annexed into the Ottoman Empire. We have few options in the face of overwhelming Ottoman forces."
 ipeTUR.48.a: "Bow into submission."
 ipeTUR.48.b: "We will resist!"
 ipeTUR.49.d: "Recognizing the extremely unfavorable balance of forces, the Despotate of Serbia has surrendered, allowing us to dissolve it as a sovereign state and make it a full-fledged part of the Ottoman Empire. Its territory will be administratively reorganized into sanjaks, and we have gained a valuable staging point for future invasions into Central Europe."
 ipeTUR.49.a: "They are wise not to resist."
 ipeTUR.50.d: "Angered by our demands for the dissolution of the Serbian Despotate, the rulers of Serbia have declared independence from Ottoman control! Despite the extremely unfavorable balance of forces, the Serbians intend to resist to the last man. Only by spilling blood will we be able to annex Serbia and gain a new staging point for future invasions into Central Europe."
 ipeTUR.50.a: "Serbia will be destroyed!"
 ipeTUR.51.t: "The Fate of Greece"
 ipeTUR.51.d: "In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine Empire was divided into numerous Greek and Latin successor states, including the Duchy of Athens and the Despotate of the Morea, which eventually came to recognize Byzantine suzerainty once again before the final Fall of Constantinople. Since then, they have been subjects of the Ottoman Empire, paying taxes and contributing troops to the Empire’s campaigns. However, with the fall of the last remaining independent states in mainland Greece, it is time for Athens and the Morea to come indefinitely under direct Ottoman control."
 ipeTUR.51.a: "Greece is ours!"
 janissary_decadence.2.a.tooltip: "§RIf the Janissaries are not disbanded, they may continue their behavior of deposing Ottoman [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle]s while they are disloyal.§!"
 ipeTUR.52.t: "Kiliç alayi"
 ipeTUR.52.d: "Upon the deposition and murder of the first Ottoman [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] by the Janissaries, a new precedent was set: those monarchs of the Ottoman Empire who did not do their utmost to appease the likes of the Janissaries would be forcefully overthrown, and likely killed. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has done little to gain favor with the Janissaries, and even encouraged their ire through his various transgressions. As such, the Janissaries have once again stormed the place, capturing the [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle]. Already they have enthroned a new ruler, who is little more than a puppet."
 ipeTUR.52.a: "We will perhaps never escape the clutches of the Janissaries."
 janissary_puppet: "Janissary Puppet"
 desc_janissary_puppet: "The current ruler is a puppet of the Janissaries, with his predecessor having been violently deposed upon failing to appease them. We will need a more capable ruler to excise the influence of the Janissaries from the country."
 ipeTUR.53.t: "Advancement of the Janissaries"
 ipeTUR.53.d: "Over time, the Janissaries have gained increasing amounts of influence in the country, with many of them going on to not only take up prominent military but also administrative positions. With the Janissaries gaining control over more and more aspects of our government, we should keep an eye on their rise in power, to ensure that they recognize the fact that the $MONARCHTITLE$'s will is still absolute."
 ipeTUR.53.a: "Ok."
 EST_VAL_JANISSARIES_ADVANCES: "Advancement of the Janissaries"
 ipeTUR.54.t: "Declining Power of the Janissaries"
 ipeTUR.54.d: "For a myriad number of reasons, including the difficulty of recruiting new Janissaries, the lessening use of them in warfare, and the gradual loss of their positions in both military and administration, the Janissaries have been experiencing a decrease in power. For now, the Janissaries' influence is greatly diminished, and they have lost the hold over the government that they usually possess."
 EST_VAL_JANISSARIES_DECLINES: "Decline of the Janissaries"
 ipeTUR.55.t: "The Janissary Revolt"
 ipeTUR.55.d: "A new revolt of the Janissaries has broken out in $CAPITAL$, with its leaders demanding greater pay from the young Mehmed II, who was suddenly thrust into power upon the abdication of his father Murad II in 1444. Although Murad II managed to quash the grave threat posed by the Crusade of Varna, he has once again stepped away from national affairs, leaving his son Mehmed to continue governing the country with his advisors.\n\nIt does not seem as though the young Mehmed will be capable of substantively defeating this revolt, and its success would pose a grave threat to Ottoman power. We may need to call upon Murad's services yet again, perhaps until Mehmed comes of age."
 ipeTUR.55.a: "Simply give the Janissaries what they demand."
 ipeTUR.55.b: "Summon Murad to deal with them!"
 ipeTUR.56.t: "The Death of Murad II"
 ipeTUR.56.d: "At long last, Murad II has died, leaving behind the legacy of a great empire. Under his reign, he expanded the territories of the Ottoman Empire deep into the Balkans, and although he temporarily abdicated and left the reins of power to his young son Mehmed, readily answered the call when he was summoned to crush the Christian crusaders at the Battle of Varna. Since the time he was called back to crush a janissary revolt, Murad II continued his steady rulership, stabilizing the frontiers of the nation."
 ipeTUR.56.a: "He will be remembered as Ghazi."
 non_christian_janissaries_2: "Growing Recruitment of Muslim Janissaries"
 desc_non_christian_janissaries_2: "The increasing recruitment of non-Christians by the Janissaries has led to a severe decline in Janissary discipline, such that the Janissary corps is now hardly distinguishable from its fellow military contingents. With the ranks of the Janissaries swelling, it can now hardly even be considered an elite force, and is at best an impediment to the Ottoman government, continuing to sap the treasury."
 ipeTUR.57.t: "The Emirate of Mount Lebanon"
 ipeTUR.57.d: "For many years, the Banû Ma‘an, a Druze dynasty hailing from the Emirate of the Chouf, have been among the most powerful families in the Levant. In the past, the Ma’anids frequently struggled for power against the Mamluk Sultanate, which sought to limit their great influence. In the aftermath of our conquest of the Levant however, the Ma’anids have pledged allegiance to us, offering to serve as tax collectors and administrators in the religiously diverse areas surrounding Mount Lebanon."
 ipeTUR.57.a: "Very well."
 ipeTUR.57.b: "§GPlay as Lebanon.§!"
