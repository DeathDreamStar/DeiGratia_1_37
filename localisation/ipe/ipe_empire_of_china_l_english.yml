 empower_the_jinyiwei_decision_desc: "In 1368, the Hongwu Emperor founded the Embroidered Uniform Guard, or Jinyiwei, to serve as personal bodyguards following his establishment of the Ming dynasty. Over time, the Jinyiwei has expanded its authority, becoming able to overrule judicial proceedings and arrest or interrogate anyone acting contrary to the interests of the Emperor. By giving more power to the agents of the Jinyiwei and expanding their headquarters in the imperial capital, we will be able to ruthlessly crush all dissent."

However, as of late, the eunuchs of China have begun to grow incredibly powerful, acquiring large estates and gaining increasing control over the imperial treasury. If China is to continue to prosper, we must appropriately check the power of the eunuchs, to ensure that they do not become a threat to the dynasty itself."
