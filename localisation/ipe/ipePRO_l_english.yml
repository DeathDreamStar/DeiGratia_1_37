 ipePRO.1.t: "The Inheritance of Anjou"
 ipePRO.1.d: "The Duke of Anjou has died without heirs, and willed his domains to us, for they are part of the de jure Kingdom of France. The Angevin territories will thus return to the royal domain, further expanding the reach of the French crown."
 ipePRO.1.a: "Anjou is ours again!"
 ipePRO.2.d: "The King of France has inherited the lands of the late Duke of Anjou, now incorporating them into the French royal domain. However, the Duchy of Bar has been bequeathed to us as part of the terms of the inheritance, thus expanding the territories ruled by the Duke of Lorraine."
 ipePRO.2.a: "Excellent."
 ipePRO.3.d: "The Kings of France have long wished to reassert direct control over the Duchy of Anjou and the County of Provence, which have been detached from the royal domain for many centuries. [FRA.Monarch.GetName] of France now is making diplomatic overtures to [ANJ.Monarch.GetName], hoping to can secure the inheritance of both the Duchy of Anjou and the County of Provence. If we accept the French monarch's proposal, both of these lands will revert to the royal domain upon the death of [ANJ.Monarch.GetName]."
 ipePRO.3.a: "The Duchy of Anjou and the County of Provence belong to France."
 ipePRO.3.a.tooltip: "§ROur country will become part of France upon the death of the current monarch.§!"
 ipePRO.3.b: "We are independent of the Kingdom of France!"

 ipePRO.4.d: "The [ANJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of Anjou, recognizing the lawful nature of royal French claims to the Duchy of Anjou and the County of Provence, has agreed to bequeathe these territories to [FRA.Monarch.GetName] upon death, thereby allowing their reunification with the French crown. Having secured the Angevin inheritance, France will be able to expand its influence elsewhere, including into the rich and fertile lands of Italy."
 ipePRO.4.a: "France will be one!"
 ipePRO.4.a.tooltip: "§GWhen the ruler of Anjou dies, Anjou will become part of France.§!"
 ipePRO.5.d: "The [ANJ.Monarch.GetTitle] of Anjou, failing to see the validity behind the legal arguments of [FRA.Monarch.GetName], has refused to will his lands to the Kingdom of France, insisting that the Duchy of Anjou and County of Provence must stay outside French royal control. If we cannot secure the Angevin lands peacefully, we will have to seize them by force."
 ipePRO.5.a: "The scoundrels!"
 ipePRO.6.t: "Defender of the Municipality"
 ipePRO.6.d: "The Republic of Genoa has not always stayed beyond the reach of outside influences. In 1396, the Doge of Genoa proclaimed Charles VI of France as defender of Genoa, in a desperate effort to stave off the depredations of the ambitious Duke of Orléans and the Visconti of Milan. It marked the first time Genoa came under the control of a foreign power.\n\nNow, a similar situation has arisen once again. [ANJ.Monarch.GetTitle] The diplomats of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made their case to us that the Kingdoms of Aragon and Naples present an ever-growing threat to the independence and security of the Republic, and that therefore we should accept assistance from foreign allies. In particular, the envoys of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have offered to introduce a French royal governor to the city of Genoa, and thereby place the city under French protection, preventing our enemies from potentially wreaking havoc upon us.\n\nAlthough we would possibly lose some of our freedom in doing this, committing to such an act could save the Republic from destruction."
 ipePRO.6.a: "We should accept French protection."
 ipePRO.6.b: "We reject foreign domination!"
 ipePRO.7.t: "Genoa Accepts French Protection!"
 ipePRO.7.d: "Convinced by our arguments that the growing strength of the Crown of Aragon presents an ever-increasing threat to the security of the Republic of Genoa, the Genovese have agreed to allow our forces into Genoa. We have installed a French royal governor in Genoa, and gained an invaluable foothold in Italy by becoming defenders of the city."
 ipePRO.7.a: "Fantastic."
 ipePRO.8.t: "Genoa Rejects French Protection!"
 ipePRO.8.d: "Unconvinced by our arguments that the growing strength of the Crown of Aragon presents an ever-increasing threat to the security of the Republic of Genoa, the Genovse have refused to allow our forces into Genoa. If we are to gain a foothold in Italy from which to claim control of lands such as Naples, we must seize Genoa by force."
 ipePRO.8.a: "They have yet to see our might!"
 ipePRO.9.t: "The French in Genoa"
 ipePRO.9.d: "To the alarm of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, the French have established a new presence in the Republic of Genoa, appointing a royal governor for the city and stationing troops there. Allegedly, the Genovese were convinced to side with the French by arguments that the Crown of Aragon posed a threat to their Republic's very existence. However, the Genovese have sacrificed their independence for protection.\n\nWe can try to sway the Republic with our own arguments, offering our support in overthrowing French rule so that Genoa may be truly independent once again. It would be, after all, easier to take control of Genoa for ourselves if the French are removed from the city."
 ipePRO.9.a: "Support Genovese independence!"
 ipePRO.9.a.tooltip: "The Genovese may reject our offer of support."
 ipePRO.9.b: "Stay out of these matters."
 ipePRO.10.t: "The Milanese Offer Support"
 ipePRO.10.d: "As time has gone on, the French presence in the city of Genoa has become increasingly oppressive to the denizens of the Republic, while the threat allegedly posed by the Crown of Aragon has failed to materialize. With matters continuing as they are, the Milanese have offered to support us in a bid for independence from the French. We may have little other way of reacquiring our freedom."
 ipePRO.10.a: "Accept their support!"
 ipePRO.10.b: "We will stay with France!"
 ipePRO.11.t: "The Genovese Rebel!"
 ipePRO.11.d: "With the support of Milanese soldiers sent to the city of Genoa, the citizens of the Republic have staged a swift coup, driving out the French royal governor and massacring French troops stationed in the city. Once again, the Republic of Genoa is independent and free of foreign influence - although perhaps not for long, as this situation presents a special opportunity for us..."
 ipePRO.11.a: "Success!"
 ipePRO.12.t: "The Genovese Reject Our Support!"
 ipePRO.12.d: "Suspicious of the expansionist whims of Milan, the citizens of Genoa have promptly rejected our offer to help them acquire their independence from the French. If the Genovese are not willing to part ways with the French, we will need to amass even greater forces to remove foreign influences from northern Italy."
 ipePRO.12.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipePRO.13.d: "After tiring of our rule in the city of Genoa, the citizens of the city have staged a swift coup, driving out the French royal governor and massacring French troops stationed in the city. Once again, the Republic of Genoa is independent and free of foreign influence - although perhaps not for long. We cannot forget Genovese transgressions."
 ipePRO.13.a: "We will retake control."

 ipePRO.14.t: "The Duchy of Lorraine"
 ipePRO.14.d: "On October 24, 1420, Isabella of Lorraine married René of Anjou, bringing together the Duchy of Lorraine, the Duchy of Anjou, and the County of Provence in a personal union. Thus, René came to rule Lorraine jure uxoris. Isabella was faithful to René and steadfastly supported his ambitions, including his failed attempt to secure the Kingdom of Naples. Since then however, Isabella has died, leaving behind her son with René, Jean II, who has long served as the governor general in Lorraine. Since René only ruled Lorraine by right of his wife, this means that Jean II is now the new Duke of Lorraine."
 ipePRO.14.a: "Then Lorraine shall go to Jean."
 ipePRO.15.a: "Very well."
