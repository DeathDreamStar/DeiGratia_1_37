 ipeCAS.1.t: "The Kingdom of the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.1.d: "In 1402, the Norman explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in the Canary Islands to take control of the archipelago on the behalf of the Kingdom of Castile. With the help of the local Guanche people, he quickly established himself in Lanzarote, before conquering Fuerteventura and El Hierro. Afterward, Pope Innocent VIII proclaimed Béthencourt King of the Canary Islands, in spite of the fact that he still acknowledged Castilian overlordship. Thus, a Christian kingdom was born on the edge of the known world.\n\nNow though, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has different aspirations for the Canary Archipelago, not even necessarily fixated on the idea of kingship. Instead, he has pondered over selling the island to different claimants, most notably the Kingdom of Portugal. But if we sold the Canaries to Portugal, it would unquestionably be a great betrayal to the Kingdom of Castile."
 ipeCAS.1.a: "Sell the islands to Portugal."
 ipeCAS.1.b: "Sell the islands to Castile."
 ipeCAS.1.c: "Maintain independence."
 ipeCAS.2.t: "The Fate of the Canary Islands"
 ipeCAS.2.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship, the monarch of the small Kingdom of the Canaries, formally an ally of the Kingdom of Castile, has come to $CAPITAL$, offering to sell his lands to us. We are surprised by his betrayal of Castilian interests, but nonetheless welcome the acquisition of new territory that will only help us expand our dominion over the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.2.a: "Let us keep this new possession!"
 stole_the_canaries: "Stole the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.2.b: "We do not wish to anger Castile."
 returned_the_canaries: "Returned the Canaries"
 ipeCAS.3.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship, the monarch of the small Kingdom of the Canaries we established decades ago has come to $CAPITAL$ to announce that he would like to sell his lands to us. We are surprised by the willingness of this monarch to surrender his kingdom, but nonetheless welcome the acquisition of new territory that will only help us expand our dominion over the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.3.a: "An welcome surprise."
 ipeCAS.4.d: "In 1402, the Norman explorer Jean de Béthencourt arrived in the Canary Islands to take control of the archipelago on the behalf of the Kingdom of Castile. With the help of the local Guanche people, he quickly established himself in Lanzarote, before conquering Fuerteventura and El Hierro. Afterward, Pope Innocent VIII proclaimed Béthencourt King of the Canary Islands, in spite of the fact that he still acknowledged Castilian overlordship. Thus, a Christian kingdom was born on the edge of the known world.\n\nThe monarch of the Canaries has mulled over the islands' fate, and after much consideration, has opted to maintain an independent domain in the waters of the Atlantic. While his claim to a Kingdom of the Canaries is supported by the Pope, both the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have designs upon this region of Macaronesia, which would be a useful base for ships traveling through the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.4.a: "Interesting."
 ipeCAS.5.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship over the Canary Islands, the monarch of the small Canary Island kingdom has decided to sell his lands to our Atlantic rivals in Portugal. This is a shocking betrayal, given that it was Castilian troops who provided the Béthencourt family with the necessary strength to conquer their domain in the Canary Islands decades ago. Even worse however, Portugal has refused to return the Canary Islands to our control, insisting that they are now a Portuguese royal possession. If we are to take the Canaries back, we may have to resort to war."
 ipeCAS.5.a: "Aggravating."
 ipeCAS.6.t: "The Canarian Revolt"
 ipeCAS.6.d: "Displeased with the sale of the Canary Islands to Portugal, Castilian, Norman, and Guanche inhabitants on the Canary Islands have joined forces and united against us, aiming to expel Portuguese control from the islands. We now have a large revolt on our hands, and will need to send a substantial military force to deal with it."
 ipeCAS.6.a: "Crush them!"
 ipeCAS.7.t: "The Treaty of Alcáçovas"
 ipeCAS.7.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over rights in the Atlantic, and most recently the succession to the throne of Castile. Now that the Castilian Civil War has come to an end, it is time for shrewd diplomacy to guide the paths of Castile and Portugal, instead of brutal warfare. By signing the Treaty of Alcáçovas, we can bring about a future wherein Castile and Portugal will no longer be enemies."
 ipeCAS.7.a: "Let us sign the Treaty of Aláçovas."
 ipeCAS.7.b: "We will never align with Castile."
 treaty_of_alcacovas: "Treaty of Alcáçovas"
 ipeCAS.8.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over rights in the Atlantic, and most recently the succession to the throne of Castile. Now that the Castilian Civil War has come to an end, it is time for shrewd diplomacy to guide the paths of Castile and Portugal, instead of brutal warfare. Portugal has agreed to sign the Treaty of Alcáçovas, hoping to bring about a future wherein Castile and Portugal will no longer be enemies."
 ipeCAS.8.a: "May our friendship come to last."
 ipeCAS.9.t: "Portugal Rejects the Treaty of Aláçovas!"
 ipeCAS.9.d: "For years, the Kingdoms of Castile and Portugal have been at odds over rights in the Atlantic, and most recently the succession to the throne of Castile. But in spite of the long Castilian Civil War, Portugal has refused to sign the Treaty of Alcáçovas, unwilling to make any pledge that reconciles it with Castile."
 ipeCAS.9.a: "They will soon learn the error of their ways."
 ipeCAS.10.t: "Sugar in Tenerife"
 ipeCAS.10.d: "Before the arrival of our settlers, the Guanche of Tenerife were poor practitioners of agriculture, often suffering from starvation because of their inability to properly irrigate and utilize modern agricultural technologies. However, now that we have arrived on the island of Tenerife, we have found that its climate is suitable for the growing of sugar, just like on the other Canary Islands. We could profit greatly from the construction of sugar plantations on this island."
 ipeCAS.10.a: "Money is a sweetness in itself."
 ipeCAS.11.t: "The Disappearance of the Guanches"
 ipeCAS.11.d: "The Guanches, having been rarely in contact with the people of the mainland, had frail immune systems and were incapable of withstanding native European and African diseases. In addition to that, even against the stipulations of the Pope, many unscrupulous plantation owners enslaved the Guanches, forcing them to work laboriously to the death in order to grow sugar. With the remaining Guanches being largely in hiding, dying, or having assimilated into the new settler population, the original Canarian culture of these islands is effectively extinct. The Canaries are now hardly distinguishable from Spain, albeit hundreds of kilometers south in the Atlantic."
 ipeCAS.11.a: "Tragic."
 ipeCAS.12.d: "Perhaps bored with the idea of kingship over the Canary Islands, the monarch of the small Canary Island kingdom has decided to sell his lands to our Atlantic rivals in Portugal. This is a shocking betrayal, given that it was Castilian troops who provided the Béthencourt family with the necessary strength to conquer their domain in the Canary Islands decades ago. However, to our surprise, the Portuguese have acted with goodwill, offering to turn over the islands to us, recognizing our important role in having conquered the islands. Clearly the monarchy of Portugal desires good relations with the Kingdom of Castile, something that can only bode well for us in the future."
 ipeCAS.13.t: "The Rise of the Genovese Bankers"
 ipeCAS.13.d: "Since the opening of the Bank of Saint George in 1407, the Italian city-state of Genoa has been a premier center of finance in the Western Mediterranean, as wealthy merchants and powerful sovereigns alike sought loans from Genoa's powerful banking families. Relations have becoming increasingly close between the wealthy Genovese bankers and the nation of $COUNTRY$, which has sought increasing amounts of loans to finance its vast imperial ventures. In continued cooperation, there can be great profit for both sides."
 ipeCAS.13.a: "Fantastic!"
 ipeCAS.14.a: "We will profit greatly from this."
 genovese_banking_spa: "Genovese Banking"
 desc_genovese_banking_spa: "The economic alliance between the Spanish Empire and the bankers of the Republic of Genoa has proven extremely profitable, expanding Genovese mercantile influence while allowing the Spanish steady access to capital for financing their imperial ventures."

 ipe_women_history_events.11.d: "Although she is not the primary candidate for the throne of Castile, few can deny the talents and virtues of young princess Isabella. As a daughter of the powerful Trastámara family, she is dearly sought after as a bride by monarchs and sovereigns from all over Europe.\n\nThe newest of Isabella’s suitors, however, comes from a familiar place. He is Ferdinand of Aragon, one of the ablest members of the Aragonese nobility, and Isabella’s second cousin. If we allowed Ferdinand to take Isabella’s hand in marriage, we could one day unite the crowns of Castile and Aragon.\n\nAs a result, we should seriously consider Ferdinand’s offer to marry Isabella, and perhaps even designate Isabella as $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s successor."
 ipe_women_history_events.11.a.tooltip: "§YIf we make Isabella our heir, we will gain a personal union over Aragon once she takes power. However, the King of Portugal may also lay claim to the title of King of Castile.§!"
 ipeCAS.15.t: "Joanna la Beltraneja"
 ipeCAS.15.d: "The designation of Isabella de Trastámara as heir to the Castilian throne has led to the disinheritance of her half-niece Joanna, who is purported to be the daughter of the Castilian [CAS.Monarch.GetTitle]. However, her parentage has always been in doubt, leading other nobles to derisively call her \"La Beltraneja,\" the bastard.\n\nBut in spite of her questionable parentage, some nobles continue to support Joanna and her claim to the Castilian throne, hoping to increase their own power at the expense of the monarchy. As a result, the ambitious [POR.Monarch.GetTitle] [POR.Monarch.GetName] of Portugal has decided to take advantage of this opportunity, taking Joanna’s hand in marriage, positioning himself to succeed as the $MONARCHTITLE$ of Castile. Once Isabella takes power in the Kingdom, we will have to reckon with the threat posed by the Portuguese."
 ipeCAS.15.a: "Joanna is certainly unworthy of the crown."
 ipeCAS.15.a.tooltip: "§ROnce Isabella takes power, the Castilian Civil War will begin. We will have to fight Portugal for the Castilian throne.§!"
 castilian_civil_war_start.tooltip: "The Castilian Civil War will begin if Isabella of Castile, the wife of Ferdinand of Aragon, takes power in Castile, and Joanna of Portugal can contest her claim to the throne."
 joanna_la_beltraneja.tooltip: "Joanna la Beltraneja is the consort of the ruler of Portugal"
 joanna_la_beltraneja_dead.tooltip: "Joanna la Beltraneja is no longer the consort of the ruler of Portugal."
 ipe_castilian_civil_war.1.d: "During the past century, the Castilian nobility have time and time again actively tried to interfere with the succession of the Castilian crown, and have not flinched from allying foreign powers. A new such conflict has erupted, and the succession is once again in question.\n\nThe legitimacy of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is being questioned by the likes of Joanna de Trastámara, who has married the [POR.Monarch.GetTitle] of Portugal and called upon his strength to secure the crown for herself. Many nobles have rallied to Joana’s cause, in hopes of winning further privileges for themselves. Meanwhile, the armies of Aragon stand ready to assist us in the coming conflict, in hopes of securing the union of Castile and Aragon. It is yet another Castilian War of Succession."

All the while, Isabella and her husband of Ferdinand have begun amassing forces of their own..."

We will have to fight to defend the newly born union of Castile and Aragon."

 ipe_castilian_civil_war.100.d: "We have triumphed in the long and bloody Castilian Civil War. We have successfully ousted supporters of the Portuguese claim to the Castilian throne, bringing about an end to internal hostilities. In the wake of the conflict, the balance of power between the royal court and the nobility has shifted, but more importantly, we have secured our links with Aragon."
 ipeCAS.16.d: "With the help of Portugal, we have overcome all odds and secured control over the Kingdom of Castile. This has brought an end to internal hostilities, and in the wake of the conflict, the balance of power between the royal court and the nobility has shifted. More importantly however, we have secured a new bond between Portugal and Castile."
 ipeCAS.16.a: "This will bring us closer to Portugal."

In the wake of the conflict, the balance of power between the royal court and the nobility of Castile has shifted, but more importantly, we have secured our links with Castile."
 ipe_flavor_spa.3716: "Ferdinand II of Aragon has been wedded to princess Isabella of Castile in Valladolid. This is a marriage of political opportunism, and not romance, as the court of Aragon has long dreamed of a return to Castile, and Isabella needed outside help in order to succeed to the throne. However, this marriage threatens to bring upon Ferdinand and Isabella a dark and troubled life, for they must fight to impose their will upon the noble oligarchies of both their countries. But despite the political nature of this union, Ferdinand loves Isabella sincerely. Only time will tell what qualities this royal couple will show."
 ipeCAS.19.t: "Decline of the British Wool Trade"
 ipeCAS.19.d: "For centuries, the wool trade formed the backbone of the English and Scottish economies, as taxes on it provided a major source of royal revenue. British wools were highly sought after because they were considered the highest quality in all of Europe. However, a new competitor to English and Scottish wools has now finally developed, in the form of merino wool from Spain. These wools are even finer than those of Britain, and their production is controlled by a wealthy association of powerful individuals known as the Mesta. The Iberians are so protective of their new industry that any attempt to export a merino sheep is now punishable by death. Consequently, the countryside is beginning to shift from producing wool to producing meat, and the golden age of the wool trade is over."
 ipeCAS.19.a: "Pity."
 ipeCAS.20.t: "The Foundation of Santo Domingo"
 ipeCAS.20.d: "We have decided to establish a settlement on the southern side of the island of Hispaniola, which we have now named Santo Domingo. Although our relations with the natives remain unclear, our settlers remain ambitious and hope to transform Hispaniola into one of the most prosperous colonies of the burgeoning [Root.GetAdjective] Empire."
 ipeCAS.20.a: "We will build it in a day!"
 ipeCAS.21.d: "Settlers from a faraway land have arrived on the southern side of the island of Haiti, establishing a settlement that they now call Santo Domingo. Their settlers have not necessarily gotten along well with us, and it seems as though conflict in our future is inevitable."
 ipeCAS.21.a: "This does not bode well."
