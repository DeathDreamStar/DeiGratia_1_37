 ipe_plague.11.d: "The plague is endemic in London, just as it is in many other large European cities. Hygiene is impossible to maintain in poorer parts of the city, where there are overcrowded tenements with no sanitation; open drains flow along the center of winding streets. The ground is slippery with animal droppings, rubbish, and slop thrown out of houses, muddy and buzzing with flies in the summer, and awash with sewage in the winter. The stench is overwhelming to the point that people typically walk around with handkerchiefs pressed against their noses. Black smoke fills the air from thousands of households that burn coal for heating. Even the outskirts of London are filled with rat-infested slums, whose development the government has failed to limit.\n\nThese appalling conditions have proven to be a ripe breeding ground for a new plague, which is now rapidly sweeping through London. It is perhaps the deadliest outbreak of plague since the time of the Black Death; thousands have been sickened and surely thousands more shall follow. Bodies are being hastily buried in overcrowded pits, and the streets are becoming increasingly devoid of people. Drivers of dead-carts regularly call for citizens of the city to bring out their dead."
