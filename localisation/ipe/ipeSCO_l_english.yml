 ipeSCO.3.t: "The Rough Wooing"
 ipeSCO.3.d: "Since the time of the Hundred Years’ War, Scotland has been joined closely with France through the Auld Alliance, placing itself in a diplomatic position that has always threatened the security of England for the benefit of France. If we invade Scotland to force a royal marriage between our dynasties, we can perhaps hope to finally break the chokehold imposed upon us by the Auld Alliance, and create a union of the crowns that will bring lasting peace to the British Isles."

 ipeSCO.7.t: "The Breaking of the Douglases"
 ipeSCO.7.d: "[SCO.Monarch.GetTitle] [SCO.Monarch.GetName] has long been in a desperate struggle to regain control of Scotland from the Black Douglases, the most powerful of all Scottish clans. While [SCO.Monarch.GetTitle] [SCO.Monarch.GetName] immediately seized control of the Livingston estates, the Douglases have managed to maintain an iron grip on power, and resisted royal prerogatives at every turn. However, [SCO.Monarch.GetTitle] [SCO.Monarch.GetName] has now gone mad, and is keen to act against the Douglases with murderous intent, hoping to punish the family for all the many quarrels of the past. As a result, we must now oppose [SCO.Monarch.GetTitle] [SCO.Monarch.GetName]’s acts of tyranny, even if it means plunging Scotland into civil war."
