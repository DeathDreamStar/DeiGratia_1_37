 ipe_slavery.4.t: "Slavery in [From.GetName]"
 ipe_slavery.4.d: "By the time the first Europeans made it to the Americas, slavery was not a foreign concept to the colonizers. The first Portuguese forays along the African coast often involved slave raids, and victims of these raids would then be sold in the markets of the Christian Mediterranean. However, the Portuguese did not find their first permanent source of slaves until they arrived at the Gulf of Guinea, whose rulers had long taken captives in petty wars.\n\nThe arrival of the Portuguese and other Europeans in West Africa led to the growth of slave-driven warfare, and colonial empires delivered the captives of such wars across the Atlantic to European colonies. En route, slaves would be held aboard crowded and disease-ridden ships, and frequently die in large numbers in the abhorrent and inhumane conditions. Once African slaves arrived in the New World, they would be treated to lives of misery, growing cash crops such as sugar, tobacco, and coffee on magnificent plantation estates governed by white overlords. Millions of slaves would die in the malarial working conditions of the Americas."
 ipe_slavery.4.a: "Death is meaningless before profits."

 desc_imported_slave_labor: "The blow of the whip drives forth production in this province, where cash crops are extensively cultivated, but only by the hands of slaves. It is a dystopian land."

 ipe_slavery.5.t: "Slavery Disappears from [From.GetName]"
 ipe_slavery.5.d: "As a result of the arrival of new inhabitants, slavery has disappeared from the province of [From.GetName]."
 ipe_slavery.5.a: "Very well."
 ipe_slavery.6.t: "The Cruelty of Slavery"
 ipe_slavery.6.d: "While plantation owners ostensibly claimed to own slaves for Christianizing and charitable purposes, the results seemed to prove otherwise. Rapes, floggings, and outright murder of slaves on New World plantations were fairly common, as slaves had no legal protections of their own, being solely reliant on the mercy and sanity of their masters, both of which were often lacking. Millions of slaves died because of both direct violence and the squalid conditions inflicted upon them by their masters, succumbing frequently to malaria and other tropical diseases."
 ipe_slavery.6.a: "Dead men cannot grow crops."
 ipe_slavery.8.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Revolution"
 ipe_slavery.8.d: "Unfettered and rapacious violence has always defined the colonial history of $FROMCOUNTRY$, which was once one of the crown jewels of our empire, with its prosperity built atop the corpses of slaves. However, those who reaped economic benefit by the whip have now been slain by the sickle, as the government of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has succumbed to the uprising of hundreds of thousands of slaves, who have ruthlessly cut down their former overlords, men, women, children, and all.\n\nAlthough we do not necessarily sympathize with the vicious slaveholders who once ruled $FROMCOUNTRY$, at this point we will only be able to retake $FROMCOUNTRY$ from the slaves if we send a military expedition to do so by force. Otherwise, the slaves will form an independent nation of our own, and potentially inspire others to find freedom."
 ipe_slavery.8.a: "They should not have dared to challenge our empire!"
 slave_revolt: "Slave Revolt"
 ipe_slavery.9.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Abolishes Slavery"
 ipe_slavery.9.d: "Although we have long used slaves to provide wealth to our country, the government of $OVERLORD$ has now ruled that slavery is an inhumane and unacceptable institution, abolishing it in our lands. Such a destructive decision will only bring us great economic harm, to such a degree that at this point we may be better off seeking independence, so that we will maintain the right to own slaves."
 ipe_slavery.9.a: "And who will grow the sugar?"
 ipe_slavery.10.t: "Slavery Extinguished in [From.GetName]"
 ipe_slavery.10.d: "We have captured the province of [From.GetName], where slaves have long worked tirelessly on the plantations for the enrichment of cruel and arbitrary colonial overlords. As the descendants of slaves, we will do our duty and free our compatriots from their condition of bondage."
 ipe_slavery.10.a: "For freedom!"
 ipe_slavery.11.t: "The Conquest of Hispaniola"
 ipe_slavery.11.d: "We have recently conquered the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, whose tropical environment is excellently suited for the cultivation of sugar. Sugar is an extremely lucrative trade good, and highly valued in Europe because of its rarity, as it is difficult to acquire from the East Indies. Turning Hispaniola into a plantation colony worked by slaves would surely generate a sizable profit, even if the slaves might cause us trouble from time to time."
 ipe_slavery.11.a: "Let the sugar flow."
 ipe_slavery.11.a.tooltip: "§YWe will use slave labor to grow cash crops in Hispaniola.§!"
 ipe_slavery.11.b: "I will not own slaves!"

 hispaniola_plantations: "The Plantations of Hispaniola"
 desc_hispaniola_plantations: "The plantations of Hispaniola are the most productive in the entire world, supplying the majority of Europe's demand for sugar. The plantations are most profitably worked by slaves, who are forced to toil to death in large numbers, pressed on by the brutality of their aristocratic masters."
 slave_uprising: "Slave Uprising"
 desc_slave_uprising: "A slave uprising has taken place in this province, resulting in the destruction of local plantation infrastructure and the freeing of local slaves, many of which have also joined the rebellion."
 ipe_slavery.12.t: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Revolution"
 ipe_slavery.12.d: "We were once in shackles, but we are now free. The malevolent overlords who previously oppressed us, humiliated us, and drove us forth by the whip are now gone, having all fled or died in the chaos of the slave revolution. Under the auspicious leadership of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, we will finally rebuild the new nation that we have won for ourselves, and do so while honoring the tenets of liberty and freedom."
 ipe_slavery.12.a: "We will not rest until all our compatriots are free."
