 ipeENG.1.t: "Margaret of Anjou"
 ipeENG.1.d: "Henry VI has always suffered from bouts of insanity, suffering a complete breakdown when his first child was born. Margaret of Anjou, his beautiful, passionate, and strong-willed wife, has now taken to rule the kingdom in his place. She understands her duty to protect the interests of the Crown fervently, a trait probably inherited from her mother and grandmother. Her mother fought to establish her husband's claim to the Kingdom of Naples. Yolande of Aragon, Margaret's grandmother, governed Anjou with a man's hand, put the province in order, and kept out the English. She is the champion of the Crown, by virtue of personality and family example.\n\nWith Henry VI increasingly unable to govern the country, it is perhaps time that we turn over management of affairs to his far more capable and collected wife."
 ipeENG.1.a: "She will rule us!"
 ipeENG.1.b: "Women are not fit to rule!"

 ipeENG.3.t: "The Great Fire of London"
 ipeENG.3.d: "London had only recently recovered from the Great Plague when disaster struck the city yet again. A fire started in a bakery shortly after midnight, spreading rapidly. Although much of the destruction could have possibly been prevented, the Mayor of London, Sir Thomas Bloodworth, was extremely indecisive on whether to create firebreaks through demolition. As a result, by the time Bloodworth did order the creation of firebreaks, the wind had fanned the small bakery fire into an unstoppable firestorm, which soon pushed north into the heart of London. St. Paul’s Cathedral was destroyed, and the fire leapt over the River Fleet, threatening the royal court. Only the dropping of the wind and the use of gunpowder by the Tower of London garrison to create effective firebreaks brought an end to the crisis. But in the end, almost the whole of London had been burned to the ground, with the vast majority of the population left homeless. It is now on our hands to mount a relief and reconstruction effort for the ruined city."
 ipeENG.3.a: "London will be reborn more glorious than before..."

 ipeENG.4.t: "The Rebirth of London"
 ipeENG.4.d: "At long last, the reconstruction of the city of London has been largely completed, still following the city’s medieval street plan. But while London remains mostly reminiscent of its former self, the reconstruction effort has greatly improved hygiene and fire safety. The streets are wider, the wharves along the Thames are more accessible, and new houses are constructed from brick and stone instead of wood. Even St. Paul’s Cathedral has been rebuilt according to the magnificent design of the great architect Christopher Wren, who also built 50 smaller churches in the city. Although the old London was a great city, the new London will be even more fitting as the capital of a nation in modernity."
