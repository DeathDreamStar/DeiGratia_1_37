 ipeMOL.1.t: "Our Brothers in Wallachia"
 ipeMOL.1.d: "Recently, our fellow Vlachs in Wallachia were invaded by the likes of the Ottoman Empire, who are now laying waste and pillage to their lands. If Wallachia falls to the Ottoman menace, we will inevitably be next. We can help prevent this, however, by sending military aid to Wallachia."
 ipeMOL.1.a: "We must help the Wallachians!"
 ipeMOL.1.b: "Do nothing."
 ipeMOL.2.t: "Our Brothers in Moldavia"
 ipeMOL.2.d: "[MOL.Monarch.GetName] of Moldavia, cognizant of our ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire, has decided to send us military aid! We have received men and arms to help us in continuing our war against the Muslim scourge of Europe. We must do our best to make the most of what we have been given."
 ipeMOL.2.a: "The Moldavians are truly our brothers in arms."
 moldavia_sent_aid: "Sent Aid"
 ipeMOL.3.t: "The Subjugation of Moldavia"
 ipeMOL.3.d: "Our forces have taken over Moldavia, an important border region of the Balkans ruled by [MOL.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOL.Monarch.GetName]. We have deposed [MOL.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOL.Monarch.GetName], making the new [MOL.Monarch.GetTitle] our puppet. Securing control of Moldavia will put us at great advantage in the general conflict between Christians and Muslims for control of the Balkans."
 ipeMOL.3.a: "Excellent."
 ipeMOL.4.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Subjugates Moldavia"
 ipeMOL.4.d: "Forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have taken over Moldavia, capturing $CAPITAL$ and deposing $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made a puppet out of the new $MONARCHTITLE$, who will now be forced to pay tribute to and obey the whims of a foreign power. As a result, we will no longer be able to choose our own path during this tumultuous era in the Balkans."
 ipeMOL.4.a: "This is not good."
 ipeMOL.5.d: "Forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have taken over Moldavia, deposing [MOL.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOL.Monarch.GetName] and making a puppet out of the new [MOL.Monarch.GetTitle]. Now that Moldavia will be forced to pay tribute to and obey the whims of $FROMCOUNTRY$, we will be left in a more vulnerable position in the Balkans. We must reacquire control of Moldavia as soon as possible."
