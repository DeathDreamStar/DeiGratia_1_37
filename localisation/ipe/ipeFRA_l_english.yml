 ipeFRA.5.t: "The Traitorous Armagnacs"
 ipeFRA.5.d: "For half a millennia, the House of Armagnac has ruled a small domain in the south of France as loyal subjects of the French king. During the Hundred Years' War, they were instrumentally important in providing aid for stopping the advance of the relentless English armies, especially showing their worth in their steadfast opposition against Burgundian forces. However, after the Hundred Years' War, the Armagnacs grew restless, and began to chafe at the centralization of power under the King of France, thus coming to take on a leading role in forming the League of the Public Weal. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is extremely angry at the betrayal of the Armagnacs, and demands that they be punished savagely for their crimes against the monarchy. Harsh measures will allow us to both claim the lands of Armagnac for the royal domain, and send a clear message to our other subjects that no rebellion will be tolerated."

 ipeFRA.6.d: "On August 17, 1424, the English armies captured Jean II, the Duke of Alençon in battle. He was forced to pay 200,000 saluts for his ransom, selling all he possessed to the English, including the Duchy of Alençon. However, the Duke of Alençon was not to be defeated yet - when Jeanne d'Arc arrived at Orléans in 1429 and promised victory over the English, the Duke of Alençon eagerly joined her, lifting the Siege of Orléans later that year. Nonetheless, the Duke was devastated when he learned of Jean's martyrdom by the English, wherein she was burnt at the stake.\n\nThe Duke of Alençon has long been dispossessed by our English enemies, and it would be just that we return to him his inheritance in Alençon, however despoiled it has been by the deprivations of the English. Shall we allow the Duke of Alençon to finally return to his long-occupied domain?"

 ipeFRA.7.d: "Upstart nobles are plotting against us, even within the House of Valois which has long ruled France. They have grown tired of the centralizing policies of the French king, and demand concessions in order to appease them. One way we could ease the angst of the nobles is by recreating the title of the Duchy of Berry and offering it to a member of the House of Valois, as a sign of goodwill regarding the intentions of the King of France."

 ipeFRA.8.d: "For years, Maine has been occupied by the English despite having been ceded to a member of the House of Valois by René de Anjou in 1441. Now that we have retaken Maine from the English, returning it to control of its rightful noble rulers would appease the nobles of France greatly."

 ipeFRA.9.t: "The Mines of Paris"
 ipeFRA.9.d: "Since the 13th century, the environs of Paris were mined extensively in order to extract stone from local limestone formations, which was used for construction all over the city. Eventually, three main networks of mines developed, made up of underground tunnels stretching for hundreds of kilometers. However, as the city expanded later on in its history, it began to absorb settlements and suburban areas built atop these mines, which became dangerously prone to collapse. When a Parisian street collapsed 100 feet under into the mines in 1774, the Royal Council decided that it would be necessary to inspect, maintain, and repair the tunnels beneath the city to ensure that such calamities would not happen again.\n\nEstablishing a new citywide organization to oversee the renovation of the mines would greatly improve safety within Paris and make it easier to build new construction in previously mined out areas. Although it would be a fairly costly venture, the mines in their current state present a constant danger to existing buildings and the lives of the Parisian public. What shall we do?"

 ipeFRA.10.t: "The Catacombs of Paris"
 ipeFRA.10.d: "Recently, we renovated the mines of Paris, doing maintenance, repair, and inspection work on the tunnels to ensure that they would not collapse again. Lately though, we have had problems regarding the local cemeteries, which, having been used for centuries, are now overflowing with millions of corpses. The situation is so severe that the cemetery's oldest corpses, reduced to nothing but skeletons, have been exhumed, and their bones packed into the surrounding roofs and walls. Already, the basement of a building bordering the cemetery has collapsed, filling it with a gruesome collection of decomposing bodies.\n\nCurrently, the Parisian cemeteries are far beyond capacity, constituting a public health and safety crisis. It has been suggested though that we could condemn Paris' urban cemeteries, and instead relocate all the bodies to the mines, perhaps creating an underground series of catacombs for the dead. While this would be an extremely expensive and time-consuming project, involving the moving of millions of bodies, it may be necessary to ensure that the dead are able to rest in peace with any semblance of dignity."

 ipeFRA.13.t: "The French Toll System"
 ipeFRA.13.d: "In the 17th and 18th century, France had dozens of different laws for how different goods were to be taxed when transported between provinces. To make matters worse, different laws applied to different provinces, causing multiple tolls to be paid by merchants travelling across the country. This not only discouraged trade and transportation, but also made it so that it was often cheaper to import goods from abroad rather than from a neighboring city.\n\nIt was up to local signeurs to apply the taxation laws, which meant that there was no regulation on lords that charged far more than they legally should. In the middle of the 18th century, it was estimated that the cost of transporting 500 livres' worth of wine from Muret to Paris was 501 livres, as a consequence of paying for dozens of tolls along the way. The provincial regulations meant that the same amount of salt could cost twenty times as much on one side of a river as on the other.\n\nIf the French economy is to grow and become prosperous, it will be necessary to reform this archaic and backward toll system, so that commerce can flow freely once again."

 ipeFRA.14.d: "The Papacy has long been in conflict with the Kingdom of Naples, as its monarchs have refused to recognize the feudal overlordship of the Pope ever since Naples was released from personal union with Aragon. However, tensions between [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [NAP.Monarch.GetName] of Naples have only now reached an all-time high.\n\nWith our inability to assert even the slightest degree of control over the Kingdom of Naples, it may be time to finally retaliate against the transgressions of [NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [NAP.Monarch.GetName], who has continually defied all auspices of Papal authority. As the sole representative of God on earth, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has the power invested within himself to excommunicate the treacherous [NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] of Naples, thereby deposing him and rendering his throne vacant.\n\nOne suitable replacement candidate for the Neapolitan throne would be [FRA.Monarch.GetName] of France, who is on good terms with the Papacy and has a tenuous claim to the throne of Naples by right of his relative, René of Anjou, who had once himself been King of Naples. As a result, the cardinals look to [FRA.Monarch.GetName] to eliminate the rogue threat that has arisen to our south, hoping that a French invasion of Italy would reaffirm Papal authority over the entire region."

 ipeFRA.19.t: "The Ambitions of the Dauphin"
 ipeFRA.19.d: "Dauphin Louis XI has never been particularly fond of his father, Charles VII. Born amid the worst of the turmoil of the Hundred Years’ War, Louis came to hate Charles because of the latter’s perceived weakness - Louis resented his father’s inability to restrain the upstart nobility, and even more so his apparent lack of competency in resisting the English, with Charles going so far as to rely upon the divine miracles of Joan of Arc to save his kingship. Consequently, Dauphin Louis dreams of the day that he will take the French throne, having grand designs to follow a policy of centralization and consolidation, hoping to finally transform France into a united state.\n\nBut for the time being, the Dauphin Louis is young and inexperienced. In 1440, he supported the Praguerie, a nobles’ rebellion against his father, in hopes of acceding to the throne early, but that ultimately failed, leading the Dauphin to beg for forgiveness from Charles. While the Dauphin is now forgiven, he nonetheless wants to remain as far away as possible from Charles. Consequently, the young Louis now asks to govern the French province of the Dauphiné, the historical namesake of the French heir’s title, so that he may gain deeper insights on the art of rulership.\n\nGiven Charles and Louis’ intense mutual hatred of each other, it may be best for them to part ways, at least for now."

The Dauphiné has been thus left in an anarchic state, being tortured still by noble feuds and local banditry.\n\nHowever, Dauphin Louis is the first and the only Dauphin to have ever taken up the task of governing the Dauphiné itself. He has begun to establish the rule of law in the Dauphiné, forbidding the escalation of petty quarrels between the nobility and clearing the roads of highwaymen. While some of the nobles have chafed at Louis’ interference, the burghers have come to appreciate Louis’ emphasis on stability, which is beginning to improve the economy of the region."

In this capacity, the young Louis has begun to involve himself in diplomatic intrigues with the various temporal overlords of Italy, particularly gaining an affinity for Milan and Savoy.

 ipeFRA.39.d: "In 1435, the French, desperate for the Burgundians to stop supporting England in the Hundred Years' War, agreed to sign the Treaty of Arras with the Burgundians. According to the Treaty of Arras, King Charles VII agreed to grant the Somme towns, including Amiens, Saint-Quentin, and Ponthieu, to the Duke of Burgundy. However, this grant was not made in perpetuity, as a clause in the Treaty permitted the French king to repurchase the towns at a later date, for the price of 400,000 crowns, a price that the Burgundians never expected the French to pay.\n\nHowever, to the surprise of [BUR.Monarch.GetName] of Burgundy, [FRA.Monarch.GetName] has managed to muster enough funds to afford this exorbitant price, now asking to repurchase the Somme towns for France. It would only be just to follow the stipulations of the Treaty."

Although never quite as independent as the Duke of Burgundy, Count Jean IV of Armagnac constantly sought to absolve himself of his feudal ties to the King of France, exploiting the turmoil of the Hundred Years’ War and going so far as to acknowledge the King of Castile as his suzerain in 1425. Nonetheless, Jean IV was incapable of securing the marriage of his daughter Isabelle to Henry VI of England.\n\nIn 1440, Jean IV partook in the Praguerie, a general revolt of the nobility against King Charles VII. It had many participants, including the Duke of Bourbon, the Duke of Brittany, and the Dauphin himself. But while Charles VII more or less forgave most of his subjects when the insurrection failed, Jean IV continued his stalwart resistance against Charles. As a result, Charles asked the formerly traitorous Dauphin to lead an army into the south of France, capturing the Armagnac territories and imprisoning Jean IV.\n\nConsequently, Jean IV has been held in captivity in Carcassonne for the last year, with his lands being directed by royal officers.

 ipeFRA.54.d: "Since the 9th century, the County of Comminges has been the property of a noble house bearing the same name. However, in the last few decades, the County has become characterized by a colorful and unusual history.\n\nMarguerite de Comminges became the Countess of Comminges in 1376, becoming known as an authoritarian and taciturn woman, allegedly having imprisoned and killed her second husband. In spite of her intimidating reputation and the fact that she was 20 years older than him, Mathieu de Foix agreed to marry Marguerite, in hopes of obtaining some power as a minor French noble by acquiring a title of relevance. Nonetheless, Mathieu’s fear of his wife never left him, and he orchestrated her own imprisonment at the castle of Bramevaque, deciding to rule over the County of Comminges himself.\n\nBut while Mathieu feared his wife, his people did not, as they angrily petitioned King Charles VII of France to free the Countess from Mathieu’s captivity. Mathieu stubbornly refused, deciding to transfer Marguerite to Foix, forming an alliance with Burgundy in the meantime. After Foix and Comminges were ravaged by the troops of Armagnac, Mathieu finally agreed to King Charles’ demand that he free Marguerite, letting her go on January 17, 1443. Even so, Marguerite died shortly thereafter.\n\nFrom that time onward, Mathieu was allowed to continue governing Comminges jure uxoris, in spite of the fact that in her will, Marguerite bequeathed her lands back to the royal domain. However, Mathieu de Foix is now dead. As he had no children with Marguerite, Comminges will finally be inherited by the King of France, in agreement with the terms of Marguerite’s final will."
