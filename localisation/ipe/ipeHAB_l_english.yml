 ipeHAB.6.t: "Death of the Albertine Line"
 ipeHAB.6.d: "Since 1379, the Albertine Line of the Habsburg dynasty has governed Lower Austria according to the Treaty of Neuberg. However, the early and unfortunate demise of Ladislaus Postumus now marks the end of the Albertine Line, bringing Lower Austria under the control of the Elder Ernestine Line, which already rules Styria.\n\nBut while Lower Austria remains safely in Habsburg hands, the fate of Ladislaus Postumus’ other territories spread throughout Europe remains uncertain. The time will soon come for the Hungarian nobility to elect a new monarch - who may or may not be a Habsburg king."
 ipeHAB.6.a: "We hope that they will choose wisely."
 ipeHAB.7.d: "Ladislaus Postumus' sudden death has left the throne of Hungary vacant. Allegations of wrongdoing run rampant, but even so, the Hungarian nobility seems intent on electing Mátyás Hunyadi, the son of the late János Hunyadi, as the next King of Hungary, thus breaking the Habsburg line of succession. However, such an action would undoubtedly bring about a great amount of ire from the Habsburg dynasty."
 ipeHAB.15.t: "The Accession of Ladislaus Postumus"
 ipeHAB.15.d: "On October 27, 1439, Albrecht II von Habsburg, the Duke of Austria and King of Germany, died suddenly after waging war against the Ottoman Turks in the Kingdom of Hungary. In his passing, Albrecht II left behind his still-pregnant wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, who would soon bear his posthumous son, Ladislaus von Habsburg.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has chosen to serve as Ladislaus’ regent since then, governing the Duchy of Austria in his stead until he should come of age. Although $MONARCH$ has done his best to keep the Austrian territories together, the nobles of the Duchy chafe at having to answer to the court of Styria. But fortunately for them, now that Ladislaus Postumus has come of age, it is time for the young man to accede as the new Duke of Austria."
 ipeHAB.15.a: "May he rule wisely."
 ipeHAB.16.d: "On October 27, 1439, Albrecht II von Habsburg, the Duke of Austria and King of Germany, died suddenly after waging war against the Ottoman Turks in the Kingdom of Hungary. In his passing, Albrecht II left behind his still-pregnant wife Elisabeth of Luxembourg, who would soon bear his posthumous son, Ladislaus von Habsburg.\n\nSince then, the Styrian branch of the Habsburg dynasty has governed the Duchy of Austria, leading a regency until Ladislaus should come of age. While Emperor Friedrich III did his best to keep the Austrian territories together, the nobles of the Duchy have chafed at having to answer to the court of Styria. But now that Ladislaus Postumus has come of age, he can finally accede as the new Duke of Austria."
 ipeHAB.16.a: "Ladislaus' time has come."
 ipeHAB.20.t: "The Illness of Ladislaus Postumus"
 ipeHAB.20.d: "Ladislaus Postumus was never the healthiest individual, with the wet nurses describing him as appearing frail and sickly from the time he was born. Although Ladislaus managed to persevere through his poor health over the years, it appears he is finally beginning to succumb, laying now on his deathbed, with the titles of Duke, King, and King-Elector attached to his name.\n\nThe death of Ladislaus Postumus brings many questions regarding the future of Central Europe, as renewed dynastic conflict will surely come about from the many thrones he has left behind. While the House of Habsburg remains preeminent among the royal families of Europe, other noble dynasties and individuals may yet take power in the void."
 ipeHAB.20.a: "And so begins the game of thrones."
 ipeHAB.39.t: "The Accession of Sigismund"
 ipeHAB.39.d: "Friedrich IV, the Duke of Further Austria and Count of Tirol, passed away on June 24, 1439, leaving behind his estates to his 12-year-old son, Sigismund von Habsburg. Although Friedrich IV began his reign impoverished, being known as Friedrich of the Empty Pockets, he had become an extremely wealthy man by the time he died, profiting immensely from the silver mines of Tirol and the Black Forest.\n\nSince Friedrich IV’s death, Friedrich III of Styria has served as Sigismund’s regent, seizing the riches of the prosperous silver mines for himself. However, Friedrich III has also waged an unpopular war against the Swiss Confederacy to regain Habsburg lands in Switzerland, thus earning the ire of the Tyrolean nobility. At this point, Friedrich III can no longer maintain his hold over Tirol and Further Austria, and therefore, the time has come for Sigismund to return."
 ipeHAB.42.t: "Death of the Tyrolean Line"
 ipeHAB.42.d: "Sigismund von Habsburg, the Count of Tirol and Duke of Further Austria, has died without heirs. With his death, the Tyrolean Line of the Habsburg dynasty has gone extinct. The County of Tirol and the Duchy of Further Austria will thus pass over to the control of the Elder Ernestine Line, finally bringing about the reunification of the lands of the Habsburg dynasty."
 ipeHAB.42.a: "Austriae est imperare orbi universo."
 ipeHAB.43.t: "The Bohemian Succession"
 ipeHAB.43.d: "In 1438, Albrecht II von Habsburg, the King of Hungary and Duke of Austria, was crowned King of Bohemia. Although Albrecht II was also crowned King of Germany and aspired to become Holy Roman Emperor, his ambitions were cut short when he died shortly after battle with the Ottoman Turks in 1439, leaving behind a posthumous son, Ladislaus von Habsburg.\n\nLadislaus Postumus inherited all of Albrecht’s titles, including that of King of Bohemia - but now that Ladislaus is dead, his claim to the throne has passed on to yet another branch of the Habsburg dynasty, the Elder Ernestines. Undoubtedly, they will pursue their claim to the throne of Bohemia, potentially even through force of arms. By enthroning yet another new generation of Habsburgs in Bohemia, we can forestall a violent conflict, but nonetheless, we may yet be able to defend our privileges and freedoms from the expansionist ambitions of the Habsburg dynasty."
 ipeHAB.43.a: "We will keep our freedom!"
 ipeHAB.43.b: "A German king would be best!"
 ipeHAB.44.t: "The Bohemian Throne"
 ipeHAB.44.d: "In 1438, Albrecht II von Habsburg, the King of Hungary and Duke of Austria, was crowned King of Bohemia. Although Albrecht II was also crowned King of Germany and aspired to become Holy Roman Emperor, his ambitions were cut short when he died shortly after battle with the Ottoman Turks in 1439, leaving behind a posthumous son, Ladislaus von Habsburg.\n\nLadislaus Postumus inherited all of Albrecht’s titles, including that of King of Bohemia - but now that Ladislaus is dead, his claim to the throne has passed on to yet another branch of the Habsburg dynasty, the Elder Ernestines. However, the Bohemian Diet has ignored that their former King belonged to the Habsburg dynasty and elected their own King, completely ignoring our legitimate claim to the throne."
 ipeHAB.44.a: "War is the continuation of politics by other means..."
 ipeHAB.48.t: "The Death of Jirí z Podebrad"
 ipeHAB.48.d: "The takeover of Bohemia by the Hussites, including the moderate Hussite Jirí z Podebrad, was not well received by our Catholic neighbors. For years, they have plotted to bring about our downfall, and the shaky diplomatic footing of the kingdom has left our nobles floundering in desperation, worrying continually about an invasion which could come any day now.\n\nIf we are to defend Bohemia from its many foes, we must find allies. Fortunately for us however, a member of Poland’s Jagiellon dynasty has offered to take the throne as King of Bohemia, being willing to take up the mantle of leadership for our war-torn nation. By allowing a Jagiellon to come to power in Bohemia, we will surely become even closer to Poland."
 ipeHAB.48.a: "We need a Jagiellon!"
 ipeHAB.48.b: "We do not need Polish aid."

 ipeHAB.50.d: "The takeover of Bohemia by the Hussites, including the moderate Hussite Jirí z Podebrad, was not well received by the country’s Catholic neighbors. The Bohemian nobles have persistently worried about the shaky diplomatic footing of the kingdom, becoming increasingly desperate to find strong allies.\n\nA kinsman of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has now taken the throne in Bohemia, being accepted by the Bohemian nobility who hoped that such a move would improve relations with us. Indeed, we have no reason to protest their decision to enthrone a member of our dynasty, as such a change will only bring Bohemia even closer to Poland."
 ipeHAB.50.a: "Let others wage wars..."
 ipeHAB.52.t: "The Death of Mátyás Corvinus"
 ipeHAB.52.d: "Mátyás Corvinus, one of the greatest monarchs in Hungarian history, is dead. As he was not from one of Europe’s great royal dynasties, both his claim and that of his successors to the Hungarian throne are weak, and without an individual of Mátyás’ authority to lead Hungary, the rulers of other countries are beginning to vie for control of the kingdom once again. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ just so happens to be one of many such contenders for the throne of Hungary."
 ipeHAB.52.a: "The Hungarian throne will be ours!"
 ipeHAB.57.a: "We must gather the nobles again."
 ipeHAB.57.a.tooltip: "We will soon have to elect a new King of Hungary, who may be a Habsburg or a local noble."
 ipeHAB.58.d: "In order to rescue Hungary from the brink of disaster following the disastrous Battle of Varna, our kinsman János Hunyadi has opted to become the regent of Hungary, representing the minor Ladislaus Postumus, who is to become the new King of Hungary. Because of the fact that János has chosen to serve as regent, we must now elect a new Voivode of Transylvania in his stead."
 ipeHAB.58.a: "Very well."
 ipeHAB.65.t: "The Inheritance of $COUNTRY$"
 ipeHAB.65.d: "For many years, $COUNTRY$ has enjoyed the exclusive privilege of the electoral dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, being vested with the power and right to vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor who would defend the lands of the Empire from foreign interference and coercion. However, in more recent history, $COUNTRY$ has come into personal union with $OVERLORD$, another influential state of the Holy Roman Empire, which lacks the electoral dignity. Now, the monarch of $OVERLORD$ has chosen to merge the inheritance of the electoral dignity with that of $OVERLORD$'s other titles, incorporating $COUNTRY$ directly into the realm of $OVERLORD$, with the monarch of $OVERLORD$ assuming $COUNTRY$'s rights within the Empire. As a result, by right of rulership over $COUNTRY$, the monarchs of $OVERLORD$ can now vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor."
 ipeHAB.65.a: "Incredible."
 ipeHAB.66.t: "The Inheritance of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipeHAB.66.d: "For many years, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has enjoyed the exclusive privilege of the electoral dignity in the Holy Roman Empire, being vested with the power and right to vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor who would defend the lands of the Empire from foreign interference and coercion. However, in more recent history, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has come into personal union with $COUNTRY$, another influential state of the Holy Roman Empire, which lacks the electoral dignity.

 ipeHAB.66.a: "We will vote wisely."
 ipeHAB.67.t: "The Extinction of the House of Gorizia"
 ipeHAB.67.d: "The last Count of Gorizia has died and the Gorizian dynasty has gone extinct. As a result, Gorizia will now become a part of $COUNTRY$, bringing greater territorial cohesion to our lands."
 ipeHAB.67.a: "Excellent."
 ipeHAB.68.t: "The Fate of Gorizia"
 ipeHAB.68.d: "For many years, the County of Gorizia has been mismanaged and thrown into turmoil by the incompetent rule of the Meinhardiner dynasty. Rudolf IV of Austria purchased the County of Tirol from the Meinhardiners in 1363, but even this acquisition has not satiated the territorial ambitions of the Habsburgs, who now wish to solidify their control over the region by securing control of the remaining Gorizian territories as well.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ recognizes that it will be difficult for him to sire a successor. As a result, perhaps it is time to finally hand over the Gorizian lands to Austria."

Rudolf IV of Austria purchased the County of Tirol from the Meinhardiners in 1363, but even this acquisition is not enough for our dynasty. To ensure the security and prosperity of our realm, we must gain direct control of the remaining Gorizian territories.\n\n[GRZ.Monarch.GetName] of Gorizia acknowledges that it will be difficult for him to sire a successor. As a result, he has agreed to sign an inheritance contract with the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, promising that we will inherit the last Gorizian lands upon his death."

Rudolf IV of Austria purchased the County of Tirol from the Meinhardiners in 1363, but even this acquisition is not enough for our dynasty. To ensure the security and prosperity of our realm, we must gain direct control of the remaining Gorizian territories.\n\nUnfortunately for us, [GRZ.Monarch.GetName] of Gorizia has no intentions of handing over his territories to us. He has refused to sign an inheritance contract with the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, swearing that his family will always govern Gorizia. In these circumstances, the only way to secure control of Gorizia is by force."
 ipeHAB.70.a: "The fools!"
 ipeHAB.71.t: "The Death of János Hunyadi"
 ipeHAB.71.d: "János Hunyadi, the regent of Hungary serving for Ladislaus Postumus, has passed away. János was one of the greatest enemies of the Counts of Cilli, aiming to limit the influence of the Celjski family over Croatia and Bosnia.\n\nNow that János has passed away however, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has the opportunity to seize control of the regency for himself.

 ipeHAB.72.t: "The Celjski Plot"
 ipeHAB.72.d: "To the horror of the Hungarian nobles and the Habsburgs, members of the Hunyadi family have uncovered an apparent plot from the Count of Cilli to assassinate Ladislaus Postumus, and seize control of the throne of Hungary for himself. The Hunyadis are bitterly disgusted, and now all of the nobility is openly questioning the legitimacy of the regency.\n\nIt is clear now that continued Celjski rule over the Hungary poses a grave threat to the nation’s stability. Nonetheless, members of the Hunyadi family are prepared to take matters into their own hands, and have proposed a plot to assassinate the Count of Cilli…"

 ipeHAB.73.a: "An eye for an eye..."
 ipeHAB.74.d: "Recently, the Count of Cilli took over the regency of Hungary following the death of János Hunyadi. However, the Count of Cilli was immensely unpopular with the Hungarian nobility, including the Hunyadi family. But now, the Count of Cilli has suddenly died from suspicious causes, leaving behind no heirs.\n\nAlthough foul play cannot be surely ruled out from the death of the last Count of Cilli, we cannot deny an opportunity to now seize control of the Celjski lands for ourselves."

Outraged, the Hunyadi family has risen up in rebellion, declaring that they will oust the murderous Count of Cilli from the throne.\n\nUndoubtedly, the Austrian Habsburgs will not look upon the Count’s crimes kindly.
