 guard_battalion_system: "The Wei-Suo System"
 desc_guard_battalion_system: "For its entire history, the Ming dynasty has employed the wei-suo system in order to defend its frontiers. The military is organized along hereditary lines, with soldiers being meant to serve in self-sufficient agricultural communities. Although the wei-suo system outsources the job of organizing the military from the imperial capital to the provinces, it is also extremely inefficient, and has made soldiering by far the least prestigious profession in the Ming dynasty. As a result, there is great reluctance among members of the general population to join the military."
 poor_military_leadership: "Poor Military Leadership"
 desc_poor_military_leadership: "Although the Ming dynasty has many experienced generals, their skill is rendered moot because they are forced to serve under the likes of inexperienced and foolish eunuchs, who know little about the art of war. As long as civil service officials continue to exercise undue influence over the affairs of the military, our generals will remain handicapped in what they do."
 dilapidated_fortifications: "Dilapidated Fortifications"
 desc_dilapidated_fortifications: "The great expense of maintaining garrisons and fortifications on the nomadic frontier has lead to our withdrawal from some of the forward defensive positions we used to hold, giving the hordes greater leeway in their incursions into China. If we do not repair our existing fortifications and assume a stronger defensive posture, we will remain incredibly vulnerable to the campaigns of the nomadic tribes."
 corrupt_officers: "Seizure of Military Colonies"
 desc_corrupt_officers: "The Ming army is largely characterized by corruption, with many of its officers going so far as to seize military colonies to transform them into private estates, forcing the soldiers on their payroll into serfdom. We must purge these indolent officers if we are to begin any substantive reform of the fragile Ming military."
 unsubdued_threats: "Unsubdued Threats"
 desc_unsubdued_threats: "The threat of the Four Oirat looms large over the northern frontier of China. The ravages of the previous Mongol invasion have not been forgotten, and fear of the potential onslaught to come instills such a level of fear among our populace that the military has become indisciplined. We must quash all murmurs regarding the potential fall of our dynasty by subjugating the Oirats."
 secured_the_northern_frontier: "Secured the Northern Frontier"
 desc_secured_the_northern_frontier: "We have managed to subjugate all the tribal states to our north, confirming the strength of the Ming military, however hampered it may be by its structural flaws. With the hordes pacified, it is clear that the Ming Dynasty is built to last."
 upgraded_fortifications: "Upgraded Fortifications"
 desc_upgraded_fortifications: "By upgrading the fortifications along the Great Wall and elsewhere, we have ensured greater security for the Middle Kingdom, protecting it from foreign incursions by nomads and other enemies. It is of utmost importance that the barbarians never make it past the fortified and defensible boundaries of China."
 projected_chinese_power: "Reaffirming Chinese Power"
 desc_projected_chinese_power: "There are now many nations which aim to threaten the supremacy of the Middle Kingdom. The presence of actual rivals to our supremacy will hopefully convince the eunuchs to cede their power over the military, allowing our generals to perform to the best of their ability."
 professionalized_the_army: "Professionalized the Army"
 desc_professionalized_the_army: "The army has been professionalized, doing away with the inefficient military colonies and hereditary soldiering of the guard battalion system. For the first time in history, China has developed a real and formidable standing army, which is not just built from disorganized peasant conscripts drafted on the spur of the moment."
 stamped_out_corruption: "Stamped Out Corruption"
 desc_stamped_out_corruption: "With all fundamental reforms having been made to the Imperial Chinese government, we have finally stamped out the last vestiges of corruption in the guard battalion system, making the Chinese army the equal to or even superior to those of peers all around the world. No longer will soldiers be able to bribe their way out of drilling."

 ipeMNG.1.t: "The Prince of Ning"
 ipeMNG.1.d: "The first Prince of Ning was awarded his title by the Hongwu Emperor for his exemplary military service. Originally, the Prince of Ning controlled a fief to the north of Beijing, but the Yongle Emperor allowed the Prince to later relocate to Nanchang in Jiangxi. The fifth Prince of Ning, Zhu Chenhao, unlike his ancestors, is known more for his hedonistic and indulgent lifestyle than any supposed military prowess.\n\nHowever ungifted Zhu Chenhao may be, he does not lack in ambition. And though we still do not know whether he chose his path out of arrogance or foolishness, he has today chosen to rise up against our $MONARCHTITLE$, declaring the Ming dynasty illegitimate. He has formed up an army, and we do not know yet where he may march. But we must answer him on the field of battle, to prove that the Mandate of Heaven belongs to us."

 banks_of_the_yellow_river: "Banks of the Yellow River"
 desc_banks_of_the_yellow_river: "The Yellow River is the most important of all the rivers in China, and the heart of its civilization. It is the most sediment-filled river in the entire world, carrying enormous amounts of loess from the Loess Plateau, and continuously depositing it along its channel. This continuous deposition of settlement can lead to the formation of underwater dams, which can develop unpredictably and eventually block the river. If the river is completely dammed by sediment, violent flooding can ensue, which can lead to the river finding an entirely new course toward the sea. As such, the Yellow River has always been both a blessing and a threat to the lives of Chinese farmers, who rely on extensive systems of dikes to stem the flooding of the river."

 desc_banks_of_the_yangtze_river: "The Yangtze River is of vital importance to China, and has been used for irrigation and transportation for thousands of years.

 ipeMNG.4.d: "This year, the Yellow River has overflown its banks once again. However, the impact was not very severe because of our prudence in repairing the dikes along the length of the Yellow River, which kept the locals safe from disaster."
 ipeMNG.4.a: "A relief."
 ipeMNG.4.a.tooltip: "§YThe next Yellow River flooding event will occur in roughly four years.§!"

 ipeMNG.6.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipeMNG.7.d: "This was not a good year for the locals living alongside the banks of the Yellow River. Although it is a regular occurrence for the Yellow River to flood, this year was particularly harsh, with the flooding destroying multiple settlements on the floodplain, causing extreme destruction to some areas. There is now a substantial risk of famine and disease spreading, and thousands of people will die. This flood will be remembered as one of the larger ones in recent memory."
 ipeMNG.7.a: "Send for help from the neighboring provinces!"
 ipeMNG.8.t: "The $YEAR$ Yellow River Flood"
 ipeMNG.8.d: "It is the greatest flood of the Yellow River in centuries. Although it is a regular occurrence for the Yellow River to overflow its banks, it has never flooded like this. Colossal amounts of water have bursted over the dikes of the Yellow River, overwhelming all flood control systems. Almost all the settlements across the Yellow River floodplain have been annihilated, and there is tremendous ruin and destruction everywhere. Hundreds of thousands of people will die, and the question lingers in the air of whether we are worthy of governing over the Chinese people."

 ipeMNG.14.t: "The $YEAR$ Shaanxi Earthquake"
 ipeMNG.14.d: "A massive earthquake has taken place in the province of Shaanxi. It has caused tremendous casualties and destruction, as the majority of the area’s population lives in yaodongs, artificial caves carved into cliffs made of loess. The yaodongs have largely collapsed, burying entire villages’ worth of people alive. The casualties are likely to number in the hundreds of thousands, and the earthquake has also caused damage to surrounding provinces."
 ipeMNG.14.a: "It is a disaster!"

 ipeMNG.15.d: "One of our generals, Cao Qin, has begun a coup attempt against the government of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. He was personally angered by Ming authorities’ efforts to investigate his business transactions, and has consequently stirred up a revolt against us, using his cohorts of Mongol descent. We have barred the gates of the palace, but must still contend with Cao Qin’s forces in the streets of $CAPITAL$."

 ipeMNG.16.d: "Dangerous times come for the seas surrounding China. Angered and frustrated with the restrictive conditions of the Haijin, or sea ban, merchants and sailors from China and beyond have begun to partake in smuggling and piracy in our waters once again. Although wokou activity in East Asia largely declined after the Korean invasion of Tsushima in 1419, it appears that the times of peace are over. No coastal city will be safe, as the resurgence of the wokou has begun."

 ipeMNG.17.d: "After enduring the conditions of the prohibitive Haijin for over a century, the merchants and sailors of China have finally had enough. For many years, the trade and activity of our merchants had been severely restricted by the sea ban, encouraging smuggling and illicit trading outside the watch of officials. Shuangyu, one of the islands off the coast of Zhejiang, has become a major entrepôt for such trade, as it is relatively close to the important ports of Ningbo and Hangzhou, but sufficiently far away enough to evade authorities.\n\nHowever, Shuangyu is no longer merely a smuggler’s hub, having gradually grown into a pirate haven. The island itself is now heavily fortified, with the help of Portuguese firearms, and pirates from the island have begun to raid throughout the coasts of China. We are now presented with a crisis, and the need to quash the barbarians of Shuangyu."

 ipeMNG.19.d: "Suffering from the highly restrictive sea ban regulations on maritime trade, Chinese and Japanese sailors alike have begun to come to our coast in order to conduct illicit commerce in various towns and outlying islands. However, their smuggling activity has gradually transitioned toward piracy, leaving China caught in a sudden resurgence of the wokou, who continually raid China’s coasts and bring about terror and destruction.\n\nSome of these raiders have now come to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, seeking safe harbor in our domain. Protecting the wokou is sure to draw anger from the Chinese, but could prove extremely profitable as the wokou bring pillaged Chinese wealth to our shores."

 ipeMNG.19.b: "We will not harbor pirates."
 ipeMNG.20.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Harbors Wokou"
 ipeMNG.20.d: "Taking advantage of our current dilemma with the wokou, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to harbor some of the pirates, protecting them from our patrolling fleets and turning a blind eye to their raids. As a result, it will become increasingly difficult to fully eradicate the threat of the wokou, as their raids may now come directly from the shores of $FROMCOUNTRY$."
 ipeMNG.20.a: "We will have to be vigilant."
 ipeMNG.21.t: "Growing Paranoia"
 ipeMNG.21.d: "The authorities’ fears of raids by the wokou have grown to the point that they have begun to even prohibit fishing boats from going out to sea. This has angered many people along the coast, for whom fishing is a major source of their livelihood."

 ipeMNG.22.d: "The wokou have found a new refuge on the island of Luzon, founding a city-state called Aparri in the former site of a Japanese trading post. From here, the wokou of Aparri hope to continue to spread piracy and terror throughout the South China Sea, ravaging all ships that dare to pass through these waters. It will require an intense effort from us to get rid of them."

 ipeMNG.23.t: "The Arrival of Limahong"
 ipeMNG.23.d: "The resurgence of the wokou has produced many successful pirate captains in the waters of the South China Sea. Among them is the famous Lim Hong, or Limahong, who has perpetually raided not only the Chinese coasts, but European shipping and trade settlements as well. Hated vehemently by both the Europeans and the Chinese, he now seeks refuge here in the lands of Caboloan. If we accept Limahong into our country, we will end up following his ways as well."

 ipeMNG.24.t: "The End of the Wokou"
 ipeMNG.24.d: "After many years, the raiding of the wokou off the coasts of China has begun to die down at last. The pirates of Shuangyu have been defeated, and the remainder have been left scattered and disorganized across the seas thanks to the efforts of Chinese military forces. Furthermore, Japanese authorities have also begun to cease cooperation with pirates and smugglers, making it more difficult for them to continue their operations. The resumption of open trade could hopefully discourage illicit activities such as smuggling and piracy in the future, and make sure that a return of the wokou era does not happen yet again."

 ipeMNG.26.d: "The end of the Chinese imperial system led to a change in the activities of the wokou, as they were able to profit less from raiding the lands of China, which were left impoverished by severe turmoil. Now, after many years, the presence of the wokou has finally begun to diminish, bringing about the end of a major era of piracy in the seas of East Asia. Japanese authorities have begun to cease their cooperation with pirates and smugglers, making it more difficult for them to continue their operations. The fall of the Chinese Empire during the age of the wokou will be an invaluable lesson for future nations on the importance of open international trade, and the need for legal commerce which discourages illicit economic activity."

A day of clear skies was interrupted violently by a sudden rumbling, which was soon followed by the billowing of dust clouds and the shaking of houses. Then, a brilliant flash of light was quickly succeeded by the sound of a great explosion. The sky turned dark as everything within two kilometers of the Armory was absolutely obliterated. Streets were unrecognizable as roof tiles and the remnants of annihilated buildings showered the city. Tremblings have been felt in cities hundreds of kilometers away.\n\nAlthough we do not know what caused the explosion, its consequences have been devastating - tens of thousands of people have reportedly died in the blast radius. Furthermore, tremendous amounts of military equipment was lost with the destruction of the Wanggongchang Armory, including vast quantities of firearms, gunpowder, and ammunition.
