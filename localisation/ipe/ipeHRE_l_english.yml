 # Imperial Mediatization
 ipeHRE.1.t: "Imperial Mediatization"
 ipeHRE.1.d: "The Holy Roman Empire is a highly decentralized state, if one can even call it a state of any kind. Ever since the end of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the Holy Roman Empire’s complex patchwork of principalities, bishoprics, free cities, and other estates has rapidly devolved into a loose association of de facto independent territories. Even though the princes of the Empire continue to acknowledge the authority of the Emperor, it is well-known that the Holy Roman Empire as an institution is on the decline.\n\nThe beginning of the Revolution in Europe has now thrown the Holy Roman Empire in a crisis, as many of the princes now call for imperial reform in order to allow the Empire to resist outside threats. One topic that has been increasingly discussed is mediatization, or the potential allocation of land of the bishoprics, abbacies, and free imperial cities to the greater territorial princes of the Empire. While the ecclesiastical officials and the burgermeisters may vehemently protest against the liquidation of church and city lands, it is perhaps imperative that we empower the strongest princes of the Empire, by redistributing the properties of the weakest."
 ipeHRE.1.a: "It will be a time of great change in the Empire."
 ipeHRE.2.d: "The beginning of the Revolution in Europe has made it imperative that the Holy Roman Empire be reformed to deal with the threat. The Emperor must decide whether to mediatize the lands of the theocracies and free cities, and consider the prospect of redistributing them among the territorial princes."
 ipeHRE.2.a: "Abandon all plans of mediatization."
 ipeHRE.2.a.tooltip: "§YNo Imperial estates will be mediatized.§!"
 ipeHRE.2.b: "Secularize only the ecclesiastical holdings."
 ipeHRE.2.b.tooltip: "§YThe lands of the theocracies will be redistributed to neighboring princes.§!"
 ipeHRE.2.c: "Secularize the theocracies and annex the free cities."
 ipeHRE.2.c.tooltip: "§YBoth the lands of the theocracies and the free cities will be redistributed to neighboring princes.§!"
 ipeHRE.3.t: "The Mediatization of $COUNTRY$"
 ipeHRE.3.d: "The princes of the Holy Roman Empire have ultimately voted to support the mediatization of its territories, redistributing many lands, including our own, to the territorial princes. The Emperor has declared this measure necessary in order to strengthen the Empire against the growing forces of the revolution in Europe."
 ipeHRE.3.a: "Curse the Emperor!"
 ipeHRE.4.t: "The Mediatization of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipeHRE.4.d: "The princes of the Holy Roman Empire have ultimately voted to support the mediatization of its territories, redistributing many lands to the territorial princes. $FROMCOUNTRY$ was one such imperial territory that has been mediatized, and as a result it has been inherited by $COUNTRY$. The Emperor hopes that by strengthening Imperial princes like us, the Empire will become more capable of resisting the growing forces of the revolution in Europe."
 ipeHRE.4.a: "This is a wonderful addition to $COUNTRY$."

 # Schmalkaldic League
 ipeHRE.5.t: "The Augsburg Confession"
 ipeHRE.5.d: "In the aftermath of Martin Luther’s nailing of the Ninety-five Theses, the Protestant Reformation has taken Europe by storm. Noble princes and common citizens throughout the Holy Roman Empire have converted in large numbers to the Protestant faith, all decrying the corruption and excesses of the Catholic Church. The Holy Roman Emperor’s demand for the Protestants to explain themselves has led the Empire’s leading reformers to together draft the text of the Augsburg Confession, which explains their religious convictions to the world. It has swiftly become the primary confessional document of the Protestant movement.\n\nThe power of the Holy Roman Emperor now threatens the freedom and independence of the Protestant princes, who fear that they one day may no longer be able to practice their faith. In order to surmount a threat as powerful as the oppression of the Emperor, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ states that we must forge a league that will organize the powers of the smaller Protestant states together. Already, whispers have been heard about the rising of the Schmalkaldic League, for which agreement to the Augsburg Confession is conditional to membership. Only through the power of such a league will we be able to resist the likes of the Emperor and the Papacy."
 ipeHRE.5.a: "Nothing has been received on our part against Scripture or the Church Catholic."
 ipeHRE.5.a.tooltip: "§YWe will request that our Protestant allies join the Schmalkaldic League. Protestant and Reformed princes from elsewhere across the Empire will join our ranks over time.§!"
 ipeHRE.6.d: "The prince of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent emissaries to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, speaking of the formation of a new alliance, the Schmalkaldic League. These emissaries state that in these perilous times, it is imperative that the Protestant princes of the Empire band together in order to resist the oppressive influences of the Holy Roman Emperor. Joining the Schmalkaldic League would send a strong message about our stance toward Imperial authority. In order to join this League, we only must accept the contents of the Augsburg Confession."
 ipeHRE.6.a: "Subscribe to the Augsburg Confession."
 ipeHRE.6.b: "We will do no such thing."
 ipeHRE.7.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Schmalkaldic League!"
 ipeHRE.7.d: "We have recently received news from our emissaries, informing us that $FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed to join the Schmalkaldic League, subscribing to the contents of the Augsburg Confession. As the Schmalkaldic League slowly expands to protect a greater number of Protestant princes from the authority of the Emperor, we will only grow stronger in our resolve."
 ipeHRE.7.a: "Wonderful."
 ipeHRE.8.d: "In the midst of the rapidly spreading Protestant Reformation, we have received news of a document known as the Augsburg Confession, which is allegedly the primary confessional document of the Protestant faith, containing within it the justification for the moral convictions behind many of the leaders of the movement. It is now being read widely by the citizens of $COUNTRY$, who are beginning to develop their own thoughts on the document.\n\nSome citizens of $COUNTRY$ have petitioned $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to make $COUNTRY$ into a Protestant city, and likewise join the Schmalkaldic League, a growing alliance of Protestant princes resisting the Holy Roman Emperor. Thanks to the existence of the League, if we do convert to Protestantism, we will not be alone."
 ipeHRE.8.b: "Burn these documents and make sure they are never read again."
 ipeHRE.9.d: "The leaders of the Schmalkaldic League have sent emissaries to $COUNTRY$, speaking of the need to expand their alliance of Protestant princes to include an even greater part of Germany. These emissaries state that in these perilous times, it is imperative that all Protestants in the Empire band together in order to resist the oppressive influences of the Holy Roman Emperor. Furthermore, they insist that membership in the League should not only be restricted to princes, inviting free cities like ours to join. Joining the Schmalkaldic League would send a strong message about our stance toward Imperial authority, and signal the backing of the common people for the Protestant Reformation. In order to join this League, we only must accept the contents of the Augsburg Confession."
 ipeHRE.10.d: "The leaders of the Schmalkaldic League have sent emissaries to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, speaking of the need to expand their alliance of Protestant princes to include an even greater part of Germany. These emissaries state that in these perilous times, it is imperative that the Protestant princes of the Empire band together in order to resist the oppressive influences of the Holy Roman Emperor. Joining the Schmalkaldic League would send a strong message about our stance toward Imperial authority. In order to join this League, we only must accept the contents of the Augsburg Confession."
 ipeHRE.11.t: "$COUNTRY$ Leaves the Schmalkaldic League!"
 ipeHRE.11.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has decided that $COUNTRY$ must leave the Schmalkaldic League. While we saw merit in the League earlier and previously supported its task of uniting the Protestant princes, we can be part of it no longer."
 ipeHRE.11.a: "We wish them the best of luck."
 ipeHRE.12.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Leaves the Schmalkaldic League"
 ipeHRE.12.d: "For reasons that are hitherto unknown to us, the leader of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to withdraw from the Schmalkaldic League. This is an unfortunate loss for us, as we will need cooperation from all the Protestant princes if we are to triumph over the likes of the Holy Roman Emperor."
 ipeHRE.12.a: "We don't need them!"
 ipeHRE.13.t: "$COUNTRY$ Leads the Schmalkaldic League!"
 ipeHRE.13.d: "For reasons that are hitherto unknown to us, the leader of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has decided to withdraw from the Schmalkaldic League. Although this is an unfortunate loss for the League, its members have nonetheless decided to vote $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to succeed as the League’s next leader. We will need support from all the remaining Protestant princes if we are to triumph over the Holy Roman Emperor."
 ipeHRE.13.a: "We are glad to lead the League."
 ipeHRE.13.a.tooltip: "§YWe will become the new leaders of the Schmalkaldic League. Protestant and Reformed princes from elsewhere across the Empire will join our ranks over time.§!"
 ipeHRE.14.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Leads the Schmalkaldic League!"
 ipeHRE.14.d: "We have found a new leader for the Schmalkaldic League, and will follow the footsteps of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Although the loss of our last leader was unfortunate for the League, even with only our remaining members, we will be able to triumph over the Holy Roman Emperor."
 ipeHRE.14.a: "We hope that they will act wisely."
 ipeHRE.15.t: "The Beginning of the Schmalkaldic War"
 ipeHRE.15.d: "Many years ago, the Schmalkaldic League was formed as a united front of Protestant princes, who aimed to protect themselves from the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor so that they could practice their faith in peace. Over time, many Imperial states joined the League in order to preserve their religious freedoms, resulting in a swelling of the League to its current size. Now, the leaders of the League state that they have anticipated an attack on it by the likes of the Holy Roman Emperor, and as such have told its members to mobilize their forces. They have launched a preemptive attack on the Empire, and will not surrender easily."
 ipeHRE.15.a: "The time has come for confrontation."
 ipeHRE.15.a.tooltip: "§RIf the Emperor occupies the capital of the leader of the Schmalkaldic League, the Emperor can disband the League by decision.§!"
 ipeHRE.15.b: "They will regret this..."
 ipeHRE.15.b.tooltip: "§YIf you occupy the capital of the leader of the Schmalkaldic League, you can disband the League by decision.§!"
 ipeHRE.16.t: "The Disbanding of the Schmalkaldic League"
 ipeHRE.16.d: "Over time, the Schmalkaldic League, an alliance of Protestant princes formed to resist the Emperor, has gradually lost all its members. Now that there is no one left to represent the League, we can now definitively declare that it has been defeated. This does not mean, however, that we will not face additional religious conflicts in the future."
 ipeHRE.16.a: "But how will we protect ourselves from the Emperor?"
 ipeHRE.16.a.tooltip: "§YWith the disbanding of the Schmalkaldic League, the Evangelical Union is now able to form in the future.§!"
 ipeHRE.16.b: "A relief."
 ipeHRE.17.d: "Over time, the Schmalkaldic League, an alliance of Protestant princes formed to resist the Emperor, has gradually lost all its members. Now that there is no one left to represent the League, we can now definitively declare that it has been defeated. This does not mean, however, that we will not face additional religious conflicts in the future."
 ipeHRE.18.d: "After a fierce and aggressive campaign through the heart of the Holy Roman Empire, the forces of $EMPEROR$ have finally forced the Schmalkaldic League to its knees. With the Holy Roman Emperor gaining ground, the Schmalkaldic League has begun to fall apart. It is appearing that the Empire will ultimately emerge victorious."
 ipeHRE.18.a: "They will be punished..."
 ipeHRE.19.a: "We were unable to resist..."
 ipeHRE.21.d: "Many years have passed since the Schmalkaldic League’s last major conflict. Its survival into the present arguably has proven that it has succeeded in its role of protecting the Protestant princes from the aggression of the Emperor. Consequently, the League’s success will possibly embolden the Protestants of the Empire into continuing to aggressively assert their independence in the future, further testing the limits of Imperial authority. As such, the Empire’s greatest conflicts may be yet to come."
 ipeHRE.21.a: "It has served its purpose."
 ipeHRE.22.a: "It will not be the last league."
 ipeHRE.23.a: "We have peace, for now."

 ipeHRE.27.t: "The Inheritance of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipeHRE.27.d: "Although $FROMCOUNTRY$ has existed in a state of personal union with $COUNTRY$ for many years, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has only now merged the title of Elector with those of $COUNTRY$. Through $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s inheritance of $FROMCOUNTRY$, we have gained a seat at the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire, making us equals to all except for the Emperor."
 ipeHRE.27.a: "We will use our vote wisely."
