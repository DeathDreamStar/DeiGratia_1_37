 ipeMAW.1.t: "The Ambition of Bika Rathore"
 ipeMAW.1.d: "Bika Rathore, one of the many sons of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, has begun to tire of his peaceful life in Marwar, and now seeks to pursue a life beyond the land of his birth, pledging to win new territory for the Rathore dynasty. In particular, Bika Rathore has set his sights upon the lands of Jangladesh, a relatively poor region in the western deserts of India, inhabited by the Jats and Bhati Rajputs.\n\nAlthough it will cost us to support Bika Rathore’s planned expedition into Jangladesh, his success would expand our influence to the north, and potentially lead to the foundation of a new Rajput kingdom aligned with our own. However, it remains to be seen whether the inhabitants of Jangaldesh would accept Bika Rathore’s rule willingly."

 ipeMAW.1.a.tooltip: "§GIf Bika Rathore's expedition succeeds, he will found a new Rajput kingdom in Jangladesh.§!"
 ipeMAW.1.b: "Offer Bika Rathore the opportunity to govern Jangladesh as a part of Marwar."
 ipeMAW.1.c: "Ignore him."
 ipeMAW.2.d: "We have recently been greeted by Bika Rathore, the ambitious son of the Rana of Marwar, one of the most powerful Rajput monarchs in all of India. Jangladesh has long been a poor and impoverished land on the edges of the Thar Desert, being largely ignored by even India’s greatest empires. As a result, Jangaldesh has been greatly neglected throughout its history, and to this day, it is only but sparsely inhabited by Jat and Bhati Rajput tribesmen.\n\nHowever, Bika Rathore now promises a turn in fortunes for the inhabitants of Jangladesh. If we allow him to transform Jangladesh into his own personal kingdom, he promises to utilize all his resources to construct a great new capital for Jangladesh, and finally bring trade and prosperity to our barren homeland. But, if we refuse to accept him, we will risk war and conflict with his mighty Rajput armies. Only $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ can decide the future of Jangladesh, and whether we should stand by the old ways, or embrace a new and perhaps more enterprising way of life."

He pledges to develop and cultivate the disparate lands once known as Jangladesh, and transform his new territories into a truly prosperous and mighty kingdom. Our relations are positive with the emerging state of Bikaner, and hopefully we will continue to maintain strong ties with our fellow Rajputs."
 ipeMAW.3.a: "Wonderful news."
 ipeMAW.4.t: "The Plight of Bika Rathore"
 ipeMAW.4.d: "The inhabitants of Jangladesh did not take kindly to Bika Rathore's attempt to establish his own kingdom on their territory, and have taken up arms against Bika Rathore and his troops. It remains to be seen who will emerge triumphant in this great conflict in Jangladesh, but we may have to intervene in order to achieve a satisfactory outcome."
