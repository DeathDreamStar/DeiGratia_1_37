 ipeBRA.1.t: "The Fate of Cottbus"
 ipeBRA.1.d: "The Lords of Cottbus have long been troublesome subjects of the King-Elector of Bohemia. With their most recent attack on the local merchants who frequent the city, the brothers ruling the territory have been sentenced to compensate the victims for their crimes. However, they simply do not have the funds to issue such a compensation.\n\nNow however, the Lords of Cottbus have offered to sell us the city so that they can pay their debts, hoping that the government of Bohemia will permit the sale. As long as we have Bohemian consent, for a price, we can assert control over this prosperous town in the heart of Lusatia."
 ipeBRA.1.a: "Make the Bohemians a generous offer."

 ipeBRA.2.d: "Cottbus is one of the most important cities in the March of Lusatia, but it now seems to be slipping from our control, as the brothers ruling as Lords of Cottbus have gained an unsavory reputation as robber barons, bringing about the ire of both the town citizenry and regional merchants. Recently, the brothers were sentenced to compensate the merchants they wronged, but do not have the funds to issue such a compensation.\n\nNow, we have received an offer to sell the troublesome city to Brandenburg. Given the quarrels of the city, we may be better off ridding ourselves of it than keeping it for ourselves."
 ipeBRA.2.a: "We need the money."
