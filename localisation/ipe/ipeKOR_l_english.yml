 ipeKOR.3.t: "The Plot of the Hall of Worthies"
 ipeKOR.3.d: "In 1420, King Sejong the Great of the Joseon Dynasty established the Hall of Worthies in order to conduct scientific research and pursue technological advancement on the behalf of the monarchy. Among their many innovations included the creation of the Korean calendar system, the invention of a sophisticated rain gauge, and most importantly of all, the creation of the Korean alphabet known as Hangul.\n\nWhile the Hall of Worthies enjoyed great patronage and support under the reign of the enlightened King Sejong, they now chafe at the rule of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, a relatively inept ruler who many of the most gifted scholars in the Hall of Worthies now regard as ignorant and incompetent. In the eyes of these wise men, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is unfit to rule, and at worst even a threat to the country’s future. Many of the scholars in the Hall of Worthies now mull over deposing this unqualified and feeble king…"

 ipeKOR.4.t: "Heo Jun"
 ipeKOR.4.d: "Heo Jun is well-regarded as one of the most prominent physicians hailing from the Yangcheon Heo clan based in Hanseong. Having become a physician at the age of 29, he has written a number of medical texts, of which the most famous has been Dongui Bogam, the Mirror of Eastern Medicine. His works have rapidly diffused to other East Asian countries including China, Japan, and Vietnam, with the Dongui Bogam in particular becoming widely regarded as a classic of Oriental medicine.\n\nIn addition to his services to the royal family of Korea, Heo Jun has strived to make his practices accessible to the common people in order to benefit their healthfulness as well. Instead of using solely rare and expensive ingredients for his various treatments, Heo Jun has also made efforts to incorporate the application of common herbal remedies, with many of them being just as effective as their more costly alternatives. In fact, Heo Jun has gone so far as to write his works in Hangul instead of Hanja to make his knowledge even more usable by the common people."
 ipeKOR.4.a: "He will make an excellent court physician."
