 ipeMOR.1.t: "A Wattasid Vizier"
 ipeMOR.1.d: "Although Morocco is officially governed by the Marinid dynasty and Sultan Abdalhaqq II, in reality the country has been under the control of another dynasty, the Wattasids, for many years. Abdalhaqq's father, the previous sultan, died in an assassination after outrage against his inability to retake the city of Ceuta from Portuguese invaders led by Henry the Navigator in 1420. Although the Marinids were able to keep their hold on power, Abdalhaqq II became the new sultan, despite only being one year old. As a result, Abu Zakariya Yahya was selected as Abdalhaqq's vizier, and has maintained real control of the country ever since.\n\nEven though the public was extremely suspicious of Abu Zakariya Yahya, he has more than proved his worth throughout his reign. Despite not being able to retake the city of Ceuta, Abu Zakariya Yahya managed to encircle and force the surrender of a large Portuguese army camp outside Tangier in 1437, greatly restoring the morale of the Moroccan population after years of anarchy. As a result, Abu Zakariya Yahya and his family, the Wattasids, have become incredibly popular among the people, who no longer care about the increasingly irrelevant and powerless Marinid sultan."
 ipeMOR.1.a: "But can Wattasids rule Morocco forever?"
 ipeMOR.1.a.tooltip: "§RAfter the death of Abu Zakariya Yahya, Morocco may witness a fierce dynastic struggle between the Wattasid and Marinid dynasties.§!"
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.d: "The great Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya has died. Remembered well for his military victories against the Portuguese after the loss of Ceuta by the previous Marinid sultan, the Moroccan population was greatly supportive of Abu Zakariya Yahya's reign, even though he was only supposed to serve in capacity as Sultan Abdalhaqq II's childhood regent. Nonetheless, Abu Zakariya Yahya's popularity was so great that the Moroccan population is willing to accept the governance of yet another Wattasid vizier, this time the nephew of Abu Yahya Zakariya. While we can allow the Wattasids to continue governing Morocco, doing so could deeply embitter $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who may not want to cede power forever."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.a: "There is no harm in appointing another Wattasid vizier."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.a.tooltip: "It is possible that the Marinids will return with a vengeance to retake control of the Moroccan throne."
 ipe_flavor_mor.5.b: "We need the Marinid dynasty."
 ipe_flavor_mor.6.t: "The Return of the Marinids"
 ipe_flavor_mor.6.d: "Previously, we had relegated the Marinid sultan of Morocco to a role of irrelevance, forcing him to take a backseat to the Wattasid viziers who are now governing the country, continuing the legacy of Abu Zakariya Yahya. However, in a stunning turn of events, the Marinids have managed a successful coup, launching a campaign of mass murder against the Wattasid dynasty. The Marinids and their allies have taken up arms and slain the vast majority of the Wattasids, including $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, while the other remaining Wattasids have fled into hiding. Although fresh blood flows in the rivers, it seems definite that the Marinids will now rule Morocco in not just name, but reality.."
 ipe_flavor_mor.6.a: "The horror!"
 ipe_flavor_mor.7.t: "Wattasid Revolt"
 ipe_flavor_mor.8.t: "The Cementing of Wattasid Power"
 ipe_flavor_mor.8.d: "After having governed Morocco for decades, it appears that the Wattasid dynasty has now finally secured complete control over Morocco, rendering all dynastic competitors irrelevant, including the Marinids. With the Marinid power unlikely to ever return to Morocco, it is time for $MONARCH$ to proclaim himself as the true ruler of all Morocco, and not just the vizier of a useless Sultan."
 ipe_flavor_mor.8.a: "It is the rise of a dynasty."
 ipeMOR.2.t: "The Reunification of Morocco"
 ipeMOR.2.d: "The conquest of Ceuta by the Portuguese in 1415 sent shockwaves throughout the Muslim world. Although the Emirate of Granada still survived, the fact that the Christian kingdoms of Iberia had gained a new foothold in North Africa disturbed many courts, as it heralded a new era of Christian expansionism into territories traditionally held by Islamic states. However, with the help of many ghazis who have rallied to the Moroccan cause, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has finally driven the Portuguese from Ceuta, eradicating their foothold in the Moroccan north. Amid this new surge of religious and nationalistic fervor, the disparate factions which long governed Morocco have finally agreed to unite under $MONARCH$'s rule."
 ipeMOR.2.a: "Morocco shall be one!"
 ipeMOR.3.t: "The Reconquest of Ceuta"
 ipeMOR.3.d: "At long last, the Moroccans have retaken the coastal fortress of Ceuta, driving the Iberians from the African mainland. With this Portuguese conquest undone, Morocco is once again safe from the threat of an Iberian invasion. The success of the reconquest has only brought greater popularity and acclaim to the rule of [MOR.Monarch.GetTitle] [MOR.Monarch.GetName]."
 ipeMOR.3.a: "We will retake it!"
 ipeMOR.3.b: "Fantastic."
