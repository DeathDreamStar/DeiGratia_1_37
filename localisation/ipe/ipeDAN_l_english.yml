 ipeDAN.1.t: "The Gryfs Return to Denmark"
 ipeDAN.1.d: "Eric of Pomerania was once ruler of the Kalmar Union, ruling over Denmark, Norway, and Sweden for decades. He was an ineffective monarch, waging war against and suffering defeat at the hands of the Hanseatic League. Eric’s ignominious defeat brought about negative economic repercussions for the Kalmar Union, as Scandinavian commerce was disrupted and the Hanseatic League was no longer bound to paying the Sound Toll. Opposition from the nobility of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden led to the deposition of Eric as king and the election of Christopher of Bavaria as his successor. In the aftermath of his ousting, Eric left for Gotland, directing piracy in the Baltic Sea.\n\nNow, however, the House of Gryf has triumphantly returned from Gotland to Denmark, successfully capturing [DAN.Capital.GetName]. Although the Gryfs have succeeded in retaking the throne of Denmark, they will need to exercise additional force in order to force Norway and Sweden to recognize Gryf authority once again."
 ipeDAN.1.a: "It's good to be home."
 ipeDAN.2.a: "We will not align with the House of Gryf!"
 ipeDAN.3.t: "The Death of Christopher of Bavaria"
 ipeDAN.3.d: "After deposing Eric of Pomerania for failing to stand up to the Hanseatic League, the nobles of the Kalmar Union elected Christopher of Bavaria, the last living descendant of King Valdemar IV of Denmark, as their next king. In spite of his election, Christopher of Bavaria was deeply disliked by the nobility, who scapegoated him for bad harvests and accused him of being too German. Now that he has died without an heir however, the Kalmar Union has been left in disarray.\n\nIn Sweden, the nobles have elected Karl VIII from the House of Bonde, in hopes that they will be able to lead the Kalmar Union from Sweden. However, the Danes have elected [DAN.Monarch.GetName], not willing to yield their historical authority over the union. Norway has yet to decide on who to elect as king, leaving the entire Kalmar Union in the midst of a dynastic crisis."
 ipeDAN.3.a: "Karl VIII is not fit to rule!"
 ipeDAN.3.a.tooltip: "§RNorway may choose to join a personal union with Sweden.§!"
 ipeDAN.4.a: "We will lead this union ourselves!"
 ipeDAN.5.d: "After deposing Eric of Pomerania for failing to stand up to the Hanseatic League, the nobles of the Kalmar Union elected Christopher of Bavaria, the last living descendant of King Valdemar IV of Denmark, as their next king. In spite of his election, Christopher of Bavaria was deeply disliked by the nobility, who scapegoated him for bad harvests and accused him of being too German. Now that he has died without an heir however, the Kalmar Union has been left in disarray.\n\nIn Sweden, the nobles have elected Karl VIII from the House of Bonde, in hopes that they will be able to lead the Kalmar Union from Sweden. However, the Danes have elected [DAN.Monarch.GetName], not willing to yield their historical authority over the union. We have yet to elect a king, and must choose to between the two choices presented by Denmark and Sweden."
 ipeDAN.5.a: "We choose to remain with Denmark!"

 ipeDAN.5.b: "We choose to remain with Sweden!"

 ipeDAN.6.t: "Norway Chooses Denmark!"
 ipeDAN.6.d: "Ultimately, Norway has chosen to elect [DAN.Monarch.GetName] of Denmark as their newest king, rejecting the Swedish candidate Karl VIII. Although this gives Denmark greater legitimacy in leading the Kalmar Union, Norway’s decision to side with Denmark does not necessarily imply that the nobles of Sweden will readily accept a return to Danish rule."
 ipeDAN.6.a: "We will soon bring Sweden back into the fold."
 ipeDAN.6.b: "Pity..."
 ipeDAN.6.c: "We must contest the union!"
 ipeDAN.6.c.tooltip: "§YFrom now on, if Sweden is in a personal union war against Denmark and Norway is a union subject of Denmark, Sweden will be able to make Norway its own union subject by decision if it occupies all the continental provinces of Norway.§!"
 ipeDAN.7.t: "Norway Chooses Sweden!"
 ipeDAN.7.d: "Ultimately, Norway has chosen to elect Karl VIII of Sweden as their newest king, rejecting the Danish candidate [DAN.Monarch.GetName]. Although this gives Sweden greater legitimacy in leading the Kalmar Union, Norway’s decision to side with Sweden does not necessarily imply that the nobles of Denmark will readily accept Swedish rule."
 ipeDAN.7.b: "We will soon bring Denmark back into the fold."
 ipeDAN.8.t: "Sten Sture"
 ipeDAN.8.d: "The question of the succession remains open in Sweden, particularly because $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ does not have an heir who enjoys wide support from the Swedish government. As the nobility do not want to return to the Kalmar Union under Denmark, they have urged $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to appoint Sten Sture, a successful military commander and privy councillor, as his heir. Sten Sture appears to have remarkable qualities as a leader, and could help right the ship of state as it proceeds into the murkiness of a future beyond the Kalmar Union."
 ipeDAN.8.a: "Appoint Sten Sture as the future Regent of Sweden."
 ipeDAN.8.b: "Allow him to be a trusted advisor."
 ipeDAN.9.d: "Christopher of Bavaria, the Wittelsbach monarch of the Kalmar Union, has suddenly died without a direct heir. He was the last living descendant of King Valdemar IV of Denmark, and his death has sent the Union teetering toward disarray. Nobles in both Denmark and Sweden now each wish for their country to take a leading role in the Union. But while the Scandinavians bitterly quarrel about their political destiny, we stand to cheaply benefit from Christopher’s death. Now that Christopher’s line of the Wittelsbach dynasty is extinct, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ will come into ownership of Christopher's former possession, the County of Palatinate-Neumarkt."
 ipeDAN.9.a: "The Wittelsbach lands will be reunited!"

 desc_reconstruction_of_copenhagen: "In the aftermath of the Great Fire of Copenhagen, we have set out to rebuild the city so that it will be more resilient in the face of future disasters."
 ipeDAN.10.t: "The Rebirth of Copenhagen"
 ipeDAN.10.d: "Copenhagen has been rebuilt, but it will hardly ever be the same. Little remains of the city’s medieval street plan, and in some places the original paths have even ceased to exist. We have also tried our best to encourage the construction of brick houses to prevent the spread of future fires. Fire houses have been built in large numbers to prevent such a great calamity from striking the city again."
 ipeDAN.10.a: "Sometimes change is necessary."
 ipeDAN.11.t: "Sweden Contests Norway!"
 ipeDAN.11.d: "[SWE.Monarch.GetName] of Sweden has chosen to declare war for the kingship of Norway, despite the pleas of his nobility to avoid war with Denmark altogether. Our two kingdoms, once allies, are now locked into a bitter conflict for the future of the Kalmar Union."
 ipeDAN.11.a: "We will fight to the end!"
 ipeDAN.12.t: "Union with Oldenburg"
 ipeDAN.12.d: "In the aftermath of the death of Christopher of Bavaria, the Danish nobility have chosen to elect [OLD.Monarch.GetName] of Oldenburg as the new [DAN.Monarch.GetTitle] of Denmark. It is the beginning of a new dynastic era for Denmark and the Kalmar Union."
 ipeDAN.12.a: "We welcome this dynasty."
 ipeDAN.13.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$'s Merchants in Tranquebar"
 ipeDAN.13.d: "Recently, representatives of the Danish East India Company arrived in Tranquebar, meeting with emissaries of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] to offer a great quantity of money in return for the permission to set up base in Tranquebar. The Danish are perhaps not as threatening as the other European powers who have frequented the Indian Ocean, making them maybe ideal commercial partners. Should we accept their offer?"
 ipeDAN.13.a: "Allow the Danish to purchase Tranquebar."
 ipeDAN.13.b: "Europeans must stay out."
 ipeDAN.14.t: "Tranquebar Sold!"
 ipeDAN.14.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]’s emissaries recently met with representatives of the Danish West India Company, and accepted our offer of money in return for permission to set up base at the port of Tranquebar. Now that Tranquebar is in our possession, it will become the capital of operations for the Danish East India Company, which can now compete with other European colonial powers for control of the Indian Ocean trade."
 ipeDAN.14.a: "A worthwhile purchase."
 ipeDAN.15.t: "Danish Merchants Rebuffed"
 ipeDAN.15.d: "[From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName]’s emissaries recently met with representatives of the Danish West India Company, but refused our offer of money in return for permission to set up base at the port of Tranquebar, stating that Tranquebar cannot fall under foreign sovereignty. As a result, our merchants have come home empty-handed."
 ipeDAN.15.a: "Unfortunate."
