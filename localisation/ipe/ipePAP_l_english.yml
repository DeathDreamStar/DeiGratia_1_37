 ipePAP.1.t: "A Fief of the Papacy"
 ipePAP.1.d: "Since the 13th century, the House of Este has ruled over the city of Ferrara and its surroundings. Over time, the Este counts expanded their domains, eventually taking over the prosperous city of Modena and its countryside as well. Growing over the course of the years, Ferrara has now become one of the most splendid cities in all of Italy.\n\nRecent Popes have grown in their appetite for territorial expansion, seeking to augment the temporal power of the Papacy by seizing the lands of lesser princes throughout Italy. While the Duchy of Ferrara is one of the many targets of Papal expansion, it is also far stronger than any of the smaller princedoms.\n\nAs a result, Pope [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has sent his legates to the court of [FER.Monarch.GetName], hoping for a diplomatic solution to securing at least nominal control over the city of Ferrara. He now offers to further legitimize our rule over Ferrara and greater influence with the Curia if we would acknowledge the Pope as our feudal overlord. Such an agreement would at least temporarily cull the Papal drive for territorial expansion, and put us on good terms with the Papacy for many years to come."

To our delight, [FER.Monarch.GetName] has agreed to accept his status as a subject of the Papacy, in return for our protection and increased influence with the Curia. Now, we can exert at least indirect control over the affairs of the Duchy of Ferrara."
 ipePAP.2.a: "Their rule is blessed."
 ipePAP.3.t: "Ferrara Refuses Papal Overlordship!"
 ipePAP.3.d: "Since the 13th century, the House of Este has ruled over the city of Ferrara and its surroundings.

But unfortunately, [FER.Monarch.GetName] refuses to even nominally acknowledge the supremacy of the Papacy, refusing our request that he become a Papal subject. If we are to take control of the city of Ferrara, we must do so by force."

 desc_comtat_venaissin: "The Comtat Venaissin consists of the area around the city of Avignon in southern France, and is a territory of the Papal States. The inhabitants of the Comtat Venaissin do not pay taxes and are not subject to military service, making life in the Comtat Venaissin far more attractive than inside the rest of France. It is also a haven for French Jews, who received better treatment under Papal rule than French rule."
