 ipeTIB.1.t: "The Rise of the Rinpungpa"
 ipeTIB.1.d: "Since the 14th century, the Phagmodrupa dynasty has ruled over much of Tibet, attaining control in the wake of the fall of the Yuan dynasty. The Ming, unwilling to invest significant resources in asserting direct control over Tibet, confirmed the position of our predecessors, granting them honorary titles that augmented their prestige and legitimacy.\n\nHowever, in less than a century after the rise of the Phagmodrupa, Tibet is already about to collapse into yet another era of political fragmentation. The Rinpungpa dynasty has slowly grown in power throughout Tsang, and have become by far the most influential ministerial family in our country. We have been greatly weakened by internal feuding, and as a result, the Rinpungpa have begun to act on their ambition to seize control of the whole of Tibet.\n\nThe Rinpungpa have taken control of the town of Shigatse, which had long been sliding out of our control. With our dynasty being strained by conflict between its members, it will be difficult to resist the forces of the Rinpungpa. It remains to be seen whether we can hold steadfast against them in their bid to become the most powerful sovereigns in all of Tibet."
