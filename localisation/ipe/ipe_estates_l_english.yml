 estate_janissaries: "Janissaries"
 estate_janissaries_desc: "This estate represents the Janissary caste, an elite military unit originating in the Ottoman Empire which was instituted through the devshirme system of child slavery, by which young Christian boys were forcibly taken from their families, enslaved and converted to Islam, and incorporated into the Ottoman army.\n\nThey became famed for internal cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they are paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry before the age of 40 or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Sultan is expected."

 estate_mamluks_desc: "This estate represents the Mamluk caste, members of one of the armies of slaves established during the Abbasid era, which later won political control of several Muslim states. Typically of foreign extraction, the Mamluks form a distinct military and political class, and through their martial skills and ruthlessness, they have been able to become powerful assets, as well as wealthy landowners. Their reputation for rebelliousness and infighting makes others quite wary of their influence."
