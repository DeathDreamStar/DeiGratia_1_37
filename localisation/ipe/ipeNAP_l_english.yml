 ipeNAP.1.t: "The Princess of Taranto"
 ipeNAP.1.d: "In 1088, the Principality of Taranto was established to resolve a land dispute between the Norman nobles responsible for reconquering Sicily from the Muslims. For the following three centuries, the Principality of Taranto has existed as a powerful and nearly independent fief of the Kingdom of Sicily, and now the Kingdom of Naples. However, the previous [NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] of Naples managed to secure a marriage with a Princess of Taranto, thus acquiring the right of inheritance to the Principality.\n\nNow that the last Princess of Taranto is dead, we have inherited the Principality of Taranto, successfully integrating it with the Kingdom of Naples."
 ipeNAP.1.a: "It is a worthy addition to the Kingdom."
