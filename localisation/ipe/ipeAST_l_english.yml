 ipeAST.1.t: "The Khanate of Astrakhan"
 ipeAST.1.d: "For centuries, the port of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga on the Caspian has been controlled by the Golden Horde. It is now the greatest slave trading site on the Volga, serving as a bustling hub of commerce between Muscovy, Kazan, Crimea, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. However, the Golden Horde has become gradually enfeebled, facing breakaway successors in Kazan and Crimea and being forced to contend with the growing strength of Muscovy.\n\nAs a result, the city of Astrakhan now clamors for independence, threatening to break away from the Great Horde entirely. Losing Astrakhan would be a devastating blow to our economy, but we may not be able to prevent it."
 ipeAST.1.a: "Astrakhan is no concern of ours."
 ipeAST.1.b: "There can only be one khan!"
 ipeAST.1.c: "§GPlay as Astrakhan.§!"
