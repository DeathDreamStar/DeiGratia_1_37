 ipeBNG.1.t: "The Conspiracy of the Siddis"
 ipeBNG.1.d: "In the court of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, Habshis have taken up many important administrative and military positions, becoming quite powerful in their own right. Some even perceived the Habshis as a threat to the rule of $MONARCH$. However, $MONARCH$ did not heed these warnings until it was too late, for when he moved to divest the Habshis of their power, they launched a conspiracy upon him, and orchestrated $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s assassination at the hands of the palace guards, who so often happened to be Habshis as well.\n\nThe grand mastermind of the Habshi conspiracy, Shahzada Barbak, former commander of the palace guards, now hopes to establish a Bengali dynasty of his own, declaring himself the new $MONARCHTITLE$ of Bengal. His treachery and ambition know no bounds."
 ipeBNG.1.a: "Dark times come for Bengal."
 ipeBNG.2.t: "The Downfall of Shahzada Barbak"
 ipeBNG.2.d: "The Habshi eunuch Shahzada Barbak has proven to be a most cruel and nefarious ruler, as should be expected of the perpetrator of regicide. Although he has given other Habshi slaves powerful and influential positions in his court, this has not necessarily curried their favor, for those who seize a throne through bloodshed are just as likely to lose it in the same manner. Even though he was only recently coronated, Shahzada Barbak is now already dead, having perished to the sword of one of his fellow Habshis, Sayf-ud-Din Firuz, who had been loyal to the previous dynasty of Bengal. But even Sayf-ud-Din Firuz’s supposed loyalty to the legitimate Bengali $MONARCHTITLE$s does not surely indicate that he will be a gifted or just ruler."
 ipeBNG.2.a: "A slave is not fit to be a king!"
 ipeBNG.3.t: "The Downfall of Sayf-ud-Din Firuz"
 ipeBNG.3.d: "Few know how Sayf-ud-Din Firuz died. Some say he died of natural causes, while others claim that he was also murdered by his own Habshi palace guards, just like those Bengali $MONARCHTITLE$s who came before him. Whatever the case, the throne is now in the hands of Shams ad-Din Muzaffar, who has made sure to promptly murder Sayf-ud-Din Firuz’s infant son to make good on his claim to the monarchy. It appears that the Habshis of Bengal have no lack of perfidy, and will only all the more eagerly commit to murdering their kinsmen, so long as the profit of the whole of Bengal is involved in the matter."
 ipeBNG.3.a: "Make it stop!"
 ipeBNG.4.t: "The Demise of the Habshi Dynasty"
 ipeBNG.4.d: "It is ultimately inarguable that the foolhardy and traitorous $MONARCHTITLE$s of the Habshi dynasty have made for poor and inept custodians of the wealthy and prosperous lands of Bengal. The country has entered a dark age like none other seen before, thanks to the endless infighting and series of regicides carried out by the Habshi slaves who once served the legitimate rulers of Bengal. Just like his Habshi predecessors, Shams ad-Din Muzaffar has won his throne by blood. But almost all too predictably, he will also lose his throne by blood.\n\nBut this time, the winner of the Bengali spoils will not be a member of the Habshi dynasty. Instead, the Arab vizier Ala-ud-din Husain has emerged victorious, backing a rebel coup against the cruel Shams ad-Din Muzaffar, forcing the latter back into his citadel at $CAPITAL$. With the aid of the palace guards, Ala-ud-din Husain has secured the assassination of the final Habshi ruler of Bengal, and crowning himself as Bengal’s newest $MONARCHTITLE$. It remains to be seen, however, whether Ala-ud-din Husain will maintain his grip on the throne, as he has chosen to seize it amid an era of unparalleled internal strife."
 ipeBNG.4.a: "We wish him the best..."
