 ipePER.1.t: "The Rise of Twelverism"
 ipePER.1.d: "Originally, the Safaviyya were a Sufi religious order following the Shafi’i school of Sunni Islam. However, a man by the name of Sheikh Joneid now wishes to take control of the order, espousing Shia teachings and promoting a more militant outlook aimed at the conquest and domination of heretical neighbors. Joneid hopes to forever tie the Safavid cause to that of Twelverism, planning to lead jihads into adjacent lands.\n\nShould we allow Joneid to take control of the Safaviyya, we will also win the support of the Qizilbash, a Shia Turkic tribal group that exists in large numbers throughout the Middle East. With their aid, the Safavid conquest of Persia and other lands becomes a distinct possibility…"
 ipePER.1.a: "We will embrace Joneid's teachings."
 ipePER.1.a.tooltip: "§GThe country and all Muslim provinces will be converted to Shia Islam. We will be able to choose a new religious school. We will gain access to the Qizilbash estate.§!"
 ipePER.1.b: "We reject this heresy!"
 ipePER.2.t: "The Allegiance of Gilan"
 ipePER.2.d: "Gilan has long been ruled by the Shia Kiya'id dynasty, a faithful ally of the Safavids. With the rapid ascent of the Safavids in the Middle East, many in Gilan are now calling for a stronger allegiance to the new empire, urged on in particular by the Qizilbash. We can choose to join the Safavids directly, become their vassals, or perhaps even stay outside of their sphere entirely..."
 ipePER.2.a: "We should join the Safavid Empire."
 ipePER.2.b: "Gilan can serve the Safavids as loyal vassals."
 ipePER.2.c: "Our nation will stand alone!"

 ipePER.3.t: "Gilan Joins the Safavid Empire!"
 ipePER.3.d: "Gilan has long been ruled by the Shia Kiya'id dynasty, a faithful ally of the Safavids. With our rapid ascent in the Middle East, the rulers of Gilan have now opted to join forces with our empire, pressured by both the local Shia population and the Qizilbash. With the addition of Gilan to our nation, the religious and political authority of the Safavid dynasty will only continue to expand."
 ipePER.3.a: "Their people will serve us well."
 ipePER.4.t: "Gilan Swears Fealty!"
 ipePER.4.d: "Gilan has long been ruled by the Shia Kiya'id dynasty, a faithful ally of the Safavids. With our rapid ascent in the Middle East, the rulers of Gilan have now opted to join forces with our empire, pressured by both the local Shia population and the Qizilbash. Although the Kiya'ids will continue to govern Gilan, they will nonetheless help us in our future endeavors, participating in our wars."
 ipePER.4.a: "They are wise to serve us."
 ipePER.5.t: "Gilan Rejects Safavid Authority!"
 ipePER.5.d: "Gilan has long been ruled by the Shia Kiya'id dynasty, a faithful ally of the Safavids. But in spite of the rapid ascent of the Safavid Empire in the Middle East, the rulers of Gilan have refused to join forces with our empire, going against the wishes of both the local Shia population and the Qizilbash. While the Kiya'ids will continue to govern Gilan, their rule cannot last much longer, facing pressure from all sides."
 ipePER.5.a: "Then we must conquer them by war."
 ipePER.6.t: "The Qizilbash Rebellion"
 ipePER.6.d: "Aroused by the fiery dictates of the Safavid Order, large number of Shia tribesmen in our country known as the Qizilbash have begun a violent rebellion in an effort to spread Safavid teachings and impose Shia rule. It is clear that Safavid influence is beginning to rapidly expand beyond the original limits of the Order in Ardabil."
 ipePER.6.a: "We will crush them!"
 the_safavid_order: "The Safavid Order"
 disloyal_qizilbash: "Disloyal Qizilbash"
 desc_disloyal_qizilbash: "The Qizilbash, Shia tribesmen native to the region, have risen up in rebellion as a result of the instigation of the Safavid Order. Because of the ongoing Qizilbash rebellion, our country has been destabilized and we are less able to protect our borders."
 desc_the_safavid_order: "The city of Ardabil has long been the heart of the Safavid Order. The Safavid Order's influence is extensive, as it has tens of thousands of followers across the entire Middle East, stretching from Anatolia to Persia. Consequently, many of these followers are willing to come serve the Safavids in Ardabil, making a valuable addition to its military arm."
 ipe_flavor_per.6.t: "The Rise of the Hotaki Dynasty"
 ipe_flavor_per.6.d: "The Afghans have never been entirely settled with living under Persian rule. The rise of factionalism in the Persian court has led to a weakening of the government and the army, causing frontier regions like Afghanistan to drift ever further away from central authority. Recently, the Afghans of Kandahar, tired of the brutal rule of the Persian-appointed governors, refused to pay taxes and revolted, led by the former mayor of the city, Mirwais Hotaki. Mirwais Hotaki and his men ambushed the local governor and killed him, thereafter quickly gaining control over the whole of Afghanistan.\n\nAlthough Mirwais Hotaki only controls Afghanistan for now, we do not know if he may one day expand his ambitions. Ultimately, Mirwais is a dangerous and competent foe, and it will require a great deal of military force to defeat him and bring Afghanistan back into the sphere of our control."
 ipe_flavor_per.6.a: "Crush the Hotaki uprising!"
 ipe_flavor_per.6.b: "Allow the Afghans to go free."
 ipe_flavor_per.6.c: "§GPlay as Afghanistan.§!"
