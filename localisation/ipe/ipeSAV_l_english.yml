 ipeSAV.1.t: "Antipope Felix V"
 ipeSAV.1.d: "In November 1439, seven bishops at the rump Council of Basel elected the former Duke of Savoy, Amadeus VIII, as Pope Felix V - an antipope. Previously, the Council of Basel had suspended Pope Eugenius IV, declaring him a heretic. In retaliation, Eugenius had the council’s members excommunicated, but Felix’s claim to the papacy was nonetheless recognized widely throughout Savoy and the Swiss Confederacy.\n\nHowever, Felix V was never particularly intent on securing papal authority, the bishops at Basel only barely managed to persuade him to accept their nomination. Now, Felix V, sensing that the current schism in the Church threatens the long-term security of his family’s territorial holdings in France and Italy, hopes to reach a settlement with the Pope in Rome, offering to acknowledge his authority and therefore reunite the Catholic Church."
 ipeSAV.1.a: "Make Felix V a bishop and reunite the Church."
