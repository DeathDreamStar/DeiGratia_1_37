 ipeVEN.1.t: "The Queen of Cyprus"
 ipeVEN.1.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is without a wife, and has sent dignitaries far and wide in search of one to accompany him in his rule. One potential candidate to be Queen of Cyprus is Catarina Corner, the daughter of a Venetian patrician. If we allow $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to wed Catarina, we could greatly improve our relations with the Republic of Venice. However, at the same time, arranging such a marriage could cause unforeseen complications regarding our political independence."
 ipeVEN.1.a: "Let us take a Venetian bride!"

 ipeVEN.1.b: "Let us marry a local talent instead."
 ipeVEN.2.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ipeVEN.2.d: "The death of our monarch has brought Venetian ambassadors and warships to the shores of Cyprus. The Venetian represetnatives announced to us today that the Queen Catarina Corner had sold them Cyprus, and that it is now therefore a possession of the Republic. Whether Corner sold Cyprus willfully or under coercion is unknown, but whatever the case, the independence of our island is at stake."

 ipeVEN.2.b: "Ward off these vultures!"

 ipeVEN.3.t: "The Inheritance of Cyprus"
 ipeVEN.3.d: "Following the death of the last Cypriot king, his Venetian wife Catarina Corner bequeathed control of the island of Cyprus to us. We now have another foothold in the Eastern Mediterranean, from which we can continue to expand our control of regional commerce."
 ipeVEN.3.a: "Glory to the Stato da Màr!"
 ipeVEN.4.t: "Cyprus Rejects Venetian Interference!"
 ipeVEN.4.d: "Angered by increasing Venetian influence in Cypriot politics following the Cypriot king’s marriage to Catarina Corner, Cypriot citizens are now taking up arms and attacking Venetian merchants, proclaiming that the island will never fall under the domination of Venice. With the island in the midst of armed tumult, it will be impossible for us to take control of Cyprus by nonviolent means. To protect our interests in Mediterranean trade, we must seize control of the country by force."
 ipeVEN.4.a: "They will pay for this!"
 ipeVEN.5.d: "[CYP.Monarch.GetName] of Cyprus has long been without a wife. However, after sending dignitaries far and wide in search of one to accompany him in his rule, he has opted to marry Catarina Corner, the daughter of a Venetian patrician. The marriage of the Cypriot [CYP.Monarch.GetTitle] to a Venetian citizen will hopefully give us a new opportunity to increase our influence on the island."
 ipeVEN.5.a: "An intriguing development."
 ipeVEN.5.a.tooltip: "Once the monarch of Cyprus dies, we will have an opportunity to take over the island in the name of Catarina Corner, who will have the island sold to Venice."
 ipeVEN.6.t: "Il Ridotto"
 ipeVEN.6.d: "Il Ridotto was the quintessential and original European casino, a government-owned building that formalised gambling and exessive money loss in Venice in 1638. It was established once the Great Council gave up on preventing people from playing for money during the Carnivale. Eventually, people from all across Europe would come to Venice to test their luck, and hopefully make a quick fortune. While the wing of the San Moisè Palace was supposedly open to the public, only nobles could afford the high stakes played with there. While money flowed freely for more than a century, gambling was outlawed and Il Ridotto was closed in 1774."
 ipeVEN.6.a: "We can take advantage of this!"
