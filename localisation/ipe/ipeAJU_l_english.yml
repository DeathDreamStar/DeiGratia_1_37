 ipeAJU.4.t:0 "The Army of Ajuuraan"
 ipeAJU.4.d:0 "For its defense, our empire has traditionally depended on a standing army of mamluks, a foreign slave caste. As they have no connection to any of the tribes of our lands, they are far more effective at keeping the peace within our borders. However, many believe that they are far less effective at protecting our borders than a force of natural-born citizens would be. As a result, we are faced with the question of whether or not to continue our reliance upon the mamluks, or begin the raising of citizen armies."

Whether they are fleeing from conflict with Christian powers or warfare on the Arabian Peninsula, these denizens of the Muslim world simply all seek a better life, and as such deserve to be welcomed within our lands as fellow kinsmen. Many of these are people well-learned in theology, science, and the art of war, which could come to benefit our country greatly."
