 ipeCEY.1.t: "The Kingdom of Kandy"
 ipeCEY.1.d: "Over the years, the influence of Kotte has gradually weakened over the central regions of Sri Lanka, including the city of Kandy, which was founded in the 14th century by the King of Gampola. In recent times, Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu, a member of the House of Siri Sanga Bo, has gained dominance over the central highlands. Now, Wickramabahu has finally declared the secession of Kandy from Kotte, and seeks to found a grand kingdom of his own, which may one day overtake Kotte to become the most powerful entity in Ceylon."
 ipeCEY.1.a: "We cannot keep Kandy within our influence."
 ipeCEY.1.b: "Bring Kandy back into the fold!"
 ipeCEY.1.c: "§GPlay as Kandy.§!"
 ipeCEY.2.t: "The Spoiling of $MONARCH$"
 ipeCEY.2.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has many sons, but has always favored $HEIR$ over all the others. Displeased with the prospect that the throne of Kotte would go to $HEIR$, three of $MONARCH$’s sons, Pararajasinghe, Mayadunne, and Bhuvanaikabahu, conspired to seize the country for themselves, marching on $CAPITAL$ with three armies. Reinforcing themselves with the masses of angry mob, the brothers sacked and plundered $MONARCH$’s palace. However, unwilling to spill royal blood with [Root.Culture.GetName] hands, the brothers chose to hire a foreign assassin by the name of Salman to kill $MONARCH$, who was promptly slain in the palace chambers.\n\nIn the aftermath, Bhuvanaikabahu, and not $HEIR$, has been chosen by the remaining royal ministers to succeed to the throne of Kotte. However, Bhuvanaikabahu’s inheritance will not go undivided, as the brothers Pararajasinghe and Mayadunne will respectively receive Raigama and Sitawaka as lesser personal kingdoms of their own. The rash and violent actions of the sons of $MONARCH$ have permanently destabilized and weakened Kotte, which may yet fall prey to the whims of foreign powers."
 ipeCEY.2.a: "We have come upon an age of darkness."
 ipeCEY.3.t: "The Decline of Kotte"
 ipeCEY.3.d: "Ever since Sitawaka and Raigama were catastrophically separated from Kotte, Kotte has been in steady decline, with its hegemony over Ceylon disintegrating. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has begun to take an interest in Christianity and new arrivals from Europe, the Portuguese, who have begun exploring and trading throughout Asia. The Portuguese continue to seek new opportunities to establish their influence in India, and have taken an interest in Kotte and the island of Ceylon. Consequently, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is considering converting to Christianity and becoming a Portuguese vassal, in hopes that Kotte will benefit from Portugal’s military strength and potentially recover to become the supreme power on Ceylon once again."
 ipeCEY.3.a: "We must ask the Portuguese for protection."
 ipeCEY.3.a.tooltip: "§YWe will ask to become a vassal of Portugal.§!"
 ipeCEY.3.b: "We don't need European help!"
 ipeCEY.4.d: "Ever since Sitawaka and Raigama were catastrophically separated from Kotte, Kotte has been in steady decline, with its hegemony over Ceylon disintegrating. [CEY.Monarch.GetTitle] [CEY.Monarch.GetName] has begun to take an interest in Christianity and our mercantile exploits throughout Asia, looking for allies who might help secure Kotte’s position. Offering us an opportunity to establish our influence in India, [CEY.Monarch.GetTitle] [CEY.Monarch.GetName] has asked to become a vassal of Portugal, hoping that Kotte will benefit from our military strength and potentially recover to become the supreme power on Ceylon once again. Although accepting the [CEY.Monarch.GetTitle] of Kotte as a vassal of Portugal will increase our military and diplomatic obligations, subjugating Kotte would allow us to more effectively project our power in Asia."
 ipeCEY.4.a: "We will protect this new Christian ruler."
 offered_protection: "Offered Protection"
 ipeCEY.4.b: "We will not support Kotte."
 withheld_protection: "Withheld Protection"
 ipeCEY.5.t: "Portugal Offers Protection"
 ipeCEY.5.d: "Enticed by the prospect of expanding Portuguese political, military, and commercial influence in Asia, [POR.Monarch.GetTitle] [POR.Monarch.GetName] of Portugal has agreed to make Kotte a vassal, promising to protect our nation from all foreign threats, including our most dangerous rivals in Ceylon. Although some believe that [CEY.Monarch.GetTitle] [CEY.Monarch.GetName] has done little more than but to make Kotte a puppet state of Portugal, this will nonetheless secure our position in Ceylon for the time being."
 ipeCEY.5.a: "Excellent."
 ipeCEY.6.t: "Portugal Withholds Protection"
 ipeCEY.6.d: "Uninterested by the prospect of expanding Portuguese political, military, and commercial influence in Asia, [POR.Monarch.GetTitle] [POR.Monarch.GetName] of Portugal has refused to make Kotte a vassal. As a result, the Portuguese will not help protect our nation from foreign threats, including our most dangerous rivals in Ceylon. Kotte will have to stand alone."
 ipeCEY.6.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipeCEY.7.t: "The Inheritance of Kotte"
 ipeCEY.7.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is without heirs, leaving the succession to the throne of Kotte in question. However, now that the country is under the overlordship of the Portuguese, there is a new option available to us - we could bequeath Kotte to the Portuguese upon the death of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. Although this would end all semblances of Kotte’s sovereignty, it would ensure Portuguese protection of Kotte permanently."
 ipeCEY.7.a: "Promise Kotte to Portugal."
 ipeCEY.7.a.tooltip: "§ROur country will become part of Portugal upon the death of the current monarch.§!"
 ipeCEY.7.b: "Kotte's monarchy shall endure."
 ipeCEY.8.d: "The last monarch of Kotte has died without heirs. To our surprise, the inheritance of Kotte was bequeathed to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, who is now the new ruler of Kotte. Consequently, all semblances of Kotte’s sovereignty have ended, and we now exert full control over its portion of Ceylon."
 ipeCEY.8.a: "Kotte will be a useful addition to our dominions."
