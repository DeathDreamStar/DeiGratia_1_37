 HOLY_SITE_379_DESC: "Jerusalem is a center for many faiths, serving the spiritual needs of not only followers of Judaism and Islam but also those of adherents of all the branches of Christianity, Nestorianism included. Since it was the city where Jesus preached, died, and was resurrected, Jerusalem will always have a special significance to Nestorian Christians."
 HOLY_SITE_410_DESC: "Nestorians have lived in Baghdad through centuries of Muslim rule, including under the powerful Arab caliphates. Many of them were emigrants from the Roman Empire and supported Islamic scholarship during the days in which the House of Wisdom was still active, translating important scientific and literary works from Latin to Syriac."
 HOLY_SITE_537_DESC: "The ancient city of Quilon was settled by two Nestorian bishops in 825 AD, with permission from local Hindu rulers. Ever since, the city has had a rich history of being one of the only ports to accept extensive trade with China. It is the seat of a powerful bishop who leads one of the largest Christian communities in India."
 HOLY_SITE_2308_DESC: "Edessa is considered the birthplace of Syriac literature and philosophy, with its scholars having been guided by Nestorius against the Monophysites led by Cyril of Alexandria.

 HOLY_SITE_445_DESC: "Merv was long an East Syriac metropolitan province of the Church of the East, dating back to the fifth century; its Christian inhabitants were perhaps descended from Roman deportees. For the next several hundred years, the Christian communities of Central Asia prospered, leading to the foundation of multiple suffragan dioceses. All of this lasted until the invasion of Genghis Khan, who massacred all the urban inhabitants of the region and brought an end to widespread Christian presence in Khorasan."

Although it was separate from the Catholic and Orthodox hierarchies, rulers of Bosnia would occasionally use conversion to either religion as political leverage in order to gain support from foreign powers. However, the religion quickly disappeared following the conquest of Bosnia by the Ottoman Empire, as many Bosnians converted to other Christian sects or even Islam in the aftermath. Very little is known today about the Bosnian Church because few records of it were left by Bosnians, and most that do exist are from outside sources such as Catholics."
