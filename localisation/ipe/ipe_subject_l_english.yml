 ipe_subject.1.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Lays Claim to the Lands of $COUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.1.d: "Citing the weak claim of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty to the throne of $COUNTRY$, the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has laid a substantive legal claim to the inheritance our lands. As a result, upon the death of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, the lands of $COUNTRY$ will become part of the domain of $FROMCOUNTRY$."
 ipe_subject.1.a: "This is a distrubing precedent."
 ipe_subject.1.a.tooltip: "§ROur country will be inherited by our overlord unless we gain independence before the death of our current ruler.§!"
 ipe_subject.2.t: "The Inheritance of $COUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.2.d: "Previously, our liege laid claim to the inheritance of our lands, questioning the legitimacy of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty. With the death of our last monarch, it is time for the lands of $COUNTRY$ to pass over to our overlord."
 ipe_subject.2.a: "We have lost our patrimony."
 ipe_subject.3.t: "The Inheritance of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.3.d: "The last monarch of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has died. Previously we laid a substantive legal claim to the inheritance of $FROMCOUNTRY$, questioning the rights of its ruling dynasty. As a result of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s inability to resist our authority, their lands will now be united with ours, leaving us more free to act without having to answer to the whims of local nobles."
 ipe_subject.3.a: "My rule is absolute."

 ipe_subject.4.t: "The Secularization of $COUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.4.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has become widely known for lacking sincere devotion to the true faith, neglecting ecclesiastical duties through excessive acts of greed and debauchery. Now, our liege is greatly displeased with us, wishing to secularize our lands and return them to direct control of the central state. It appears that this is the end of $COUNTRY$ as a semi-independent clerical entity."
 ipe_subject.4.a: "Unfortunate."
 ipe_subject.5.t: "The Secularization of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.5.d: "The leader of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has become widely known for lacking sincere devotion to the true faith, neglecting ecclesiastical duties through excessive acts of greed and debauchery. Recognizing the danger that the disgraceful leaders of $FROMCOUNTRY$ pose to the faith, we have decided secularize the lands of $FROMCOUNTRY$, incorporating them under $COUNTRY$'s direct control. It appears that this is the end of $FROMCOUNTRY$ as a semi-independent clerical entity."
 ipe_subject.5.a: "The church is subservient to the state."
 ipe_subject.6.t: "The Deposition of the Republic of $COUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.6.d: "The republican institutions of $COUNTRY$ have gradually eroded over time, with escalating factionalism leaving the nation weaker and more divided than ever before. By taking advantage of the apathy of our citizenry and the corruption of our politicians, our liege has staged a coup inside $COUNTRY$, deinstituting our republic and deposing it. The Republic of $COUNTRY$ is dead."
 ipe_subject.6.a: "And this is how democracy dies."
 ipe_subject.7.t: "The Deposition of the Republic of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.7.d: "The republican institutions of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have gradually eroded over time, with escalating factionalism leaving the nation weaker and more divided than ever before. By taking advantage of the apathy of their citizenry and the corruption of their politicians, we have staged a coup inside $FROMCOUNTRY$, deinstituting their republican government and deposing it. The Republic of $FROMCOUNTRY$ is dead."
 ipe_subject.7.a: "There is no enlightenment in their democracy."
 ipe_subject.8.t: "Papal Interdict Imposed"
 ipe_subject.8.d: "Our liege, the Pope, has imposed a papal interdict upon $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, stating that our actions have unequivocally gone against the interests of both God and the Church. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has been stripped of titles, and forcibly expelled from the lands of $COUNTRY$. While the Pope now declares that $COUNTRY$'s lands will become the property of the Church, the Christian world does not take kindly to this opportunistic expansion of the Papacy's temporal power."
 ipe_subject.8.a: "This decision is not infallible!"
 ipe_subject.9.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Claimed for the Papacy"
 ipe_subject.9.d: "We have imposed a papal interdict upon the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$, as $FROMCOUNTRY$'s leaders have behaved unequivocally against the interests of both God and the Church. The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has been stripped of titles, and forcibly expelled from the lands of $FROMCOUNTRY$. While we have now declared that $FROMCOUNTRY$'s lands will become property of the Church, the Christian world does not take kindly to this opportunistic expansion of our own temporal power."
 ipe_subject.9.a: "Our rule is both spiritual and temporal."
 ipe_subject.10.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Appoints a Bishop of $COUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.10.d: "The powerful and influential nation of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has bribed church officials and used the implicit threat of military force in order to appoint a bishop in the lands of $COUNTRY$, expanding both the spiritual power, and to a lesser extent, the temporal power of $FROMCOUNTRY$. Consequently, our country is now ruled by a $MONARCHTITLE$ who is more or less aligned with the interests of $FROMCOUNTRY$, and we have thus become a Puppet Bishopric. Although we will still be able to conduct independent diplomacy, we will be forced for sometime to partake in the military and diplomatic struggles of our new overlord."
 ipe_subject.10.a: "This cannot be good for the faith."
 ipe_subject.10.a.tooltip: "§YWe will remain a subject of our new overlord until the death of our current ruler, upon which we may freely choose to become independent again.§!"
 ipe_subject.11.t: "The Puppet Bishopric"
 ipe_subject.11.d: "Previously, our overlord exercised economic and military influence in order to bribe church officials into appointing a new $MONARCHTITLE$ for our country. Now that our previous sovereign has died though, we have the choice of either continuing our alignment under a foreign power, or regain our independence. While we could continue accepting foreign protection, reaffirming the authority of our clergy would do well to protect our future independence."
 ipe_subject.11.a: "We still need the protection of a greater power."
 ipe_subject.11.b: "Let us avoid foreign entanglements."
 ipe_subject.12.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Remains Allegiant!"
 ipe_subject.12.d: "Previously, we used our economic and military influence in order to bribe the church officials of $FROMCOUNTRY$, supporting a bishop who would work to further our interests. We protected $FROMCOUNTRY$ from foreign threats, and in turn $FROMCOUNTRY$ conferred us with limited military support and religious legitimacy. However, the death of the bishop of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resulted in the coming to power of a new clerical candidate.\n\nFortunately for us, this candidate remains aligned with $COUNTRY$, and will continue to serve as our ally in the region."
 ipe_subject.12.a: "Very good."
 ipe_subject.13.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Becomes Independent!"
 ipe_subject.13.d: "Previously, we used our economic and military influence in order to bribe the church officials of $FROMCOUNTRY$, supporting a bishop who would work to further our interests. We protected $FROMCOUNTRY$ from foreign threats, and in turn $FROMCOUNTRY$ conferred us with limited military support and religious legitimacy. However, the death of the bishop of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has resulted in the coming to power of a new clerical candidate.\n\nUnfortunately for us, this candidate is no longer aligned with $COUNTRY$, having declared local clerical independence. We will be deprived of an ally in the region."
 ipe_subject.13.a: "They can be bribed once again."
 ipe_subject.14.t: "The Accession of $MONARCH$ in $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.14.d: "[From.Monarch.GetName] of $FROMCOUNTRY$, the last member of one of the many branches of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty, has suddenly and tragically died. With $FROMCOUNTRY$ lacking any direct heirs to take the throne, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has decided to leave $COUNTRY$, hoping to lead $FROMCOUNTRY$ as its newest monarch of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s ambitions are great, but it will be a monumental task to rule such a vast new realm."
 ipe_subject.15.t: "$MONARCH$ of $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 ipe_subject.15.d: "Our most recent $MONARCHTITLE$ has died without direct heirs. As a result, the right of succession has now gone to $MONARCH$ of $FROMCOUNTRY$, the most senior member of a cadet branch of the $DYNASTY$ dynasty. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has left $FROMCOUNTRY$, hoping to lead $COUNTRY$ to glory and cast a great legacy upon our national history. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$'s ambitions are great, but it will be a monumental task to rule such a vast new realm."
 ipe_subject.15.a: "We welcome new leadership."

 ipe_subject.16.a: "It is time for $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ to do greater things."
 ipe_subject.20.t: "Kaieki"
 ipe_subject.20.d: "For centuries, the military dictatorship of the shogunate has ruled over Japan, with the shogun deriving legitimacy from having been nominally appointed by the Emperor. Throughout history, the power of the shogun relative to his subjects has varied, with some daimyo outright challenging the shogun’s authority, usually only to be crushed by the shogun’s armies.\n\nThe current shogun [From.Dynasty.GetName] [From.Monarch.GetName] currently feels secure in his position of power over Japan, and has become increasingly ambitious in expanding the authority of the shogunate. As a result, he has now called upon us, the $DYNASTY$ clan, to give up control of our lands centered upon $CAPITAL$, and surrender them to the shogunate. Although it is the shogun’s legal prerogative to reorganize and even seize the territories of his subordinates, obeying this command would render our family effectively powerless, and make us no longer a factor in the constantly shifting internal politics of Japan.\n\nWhile we could resist the shogun’s command and defend our han, doing so would only inevitably lead to a war that we may not be able to win."
 ipe_subject.20.a: "We must obey the commands of the shogun."
 ipe_subject.20.a.tooltip: "§ROur country will be annexed by the shogunate.§!"
 ipe_subject.20.b: "The $FROMCOUNTRY$ clan is not fit to rule Japan!"
 ipe_subject.21.t: "Submission to the Shogun"
 ipe_subject.21.d: "For centuries, the military dictatorship of the shogunate has ruled over Japan, with the shogun deriving legitimacy from having been nominally appointed by the Emperor. Throughout history, the power of the shogun relative to his subjects has varied, with some daimyo outright challenging the shogun’s authority, usually only to be crushed by the shogun’s armies.\n\nShogun [Root.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] recognizes the recent surge in the power of the shogunate, and consequently has become increasingly ambitious in expanding its authority. As a result, we have called upon the [From.Dynasty.GetName] clan to surrender their holdings to the shogunate, as it is our legal prerogative to reorganize and even seize the territories of our subordinates. The [From.Dynasty.GetName] have promptly submitted to our command, and handed over their han to us, acknowledging our supremacy."
 ipe_subject.21.a: "They are wise to respect our authority."
 ipe_subject.22.t: "Resistance to the Shogun!"
 ipe_subject.22.d: "For centuries, the military dictatorship of the shogunate has ruled over Japan, with the shogun deriving legitimacy from having been nominally appointed by the Emperor. Throughout history, the power of the shogun relative to his subjects has varied, with some daimyo outright challenging the shogun’s authority, usually only to be crushed by the shogun’s armies.\n\nShogun [Root.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] presumed that the current state of affairs would force the daimyo to submit to his authority. As a result, we called upon the [From.Dynasty.GetName] clan to surrender their holdings to the shogunate, as it is our legal prerogative to reorganize and even size the territories of our subordinates. However, contrary to our expectations, the [From.Dynasty.GetName] clan did not promptly submit, and instead has now declared open war against what they claim to be the unjust and tyrannical rule of the shogunate. Their allies now rally to this cause, and it appears we will have to seize the [From.Dynasty.GetName] clan’s han by force."
 ipe_subject.22.a: "They will pay for this!"
 ipe_subject.23.t: "Wandering Ronin"
 ipe_subject.23.d: "Ronin are the samurai who wander Japan with no master. They became more common as Japan became increasingly centralized, with the shogun confiscating and reducing the fiefs of subdued daimyos. As fewer daimyos became capable of affording or even needed to employ large armies, the numbers of the ronin steadily rose to the point that they became a threat to national peace.\n\nTo mitigate the threat from ronin who might operate as mercenaries, bandits, or highwaymen, the shogunate began to banish the ronin from cities or otherwise place severe restrictions on where they could live. The ronin thus lived in disrepute, and occasionally were led to rebel against the authority of the shogunate entirely, seeking improvement to their status. Consequently, the shogunate would be compelled to support measures reducing the numbers of the ronin, relaxing restrictions on daimyo inheritance so that fewer fiefs would be confiscated, and allowing the ronin to join new masters.\n\nOur confiscation of the fief of the [From.Dynasty.GetName] clan has led to that clan’s former retainers becoming ronin, who now wander Japan in search of new employment. For some time, we will experience increased unrest caused by the illicit activities of the ronin."
 ipe_subject.23.a: "We will have to deal with them."
 ipe_subject.28.d: "Ronin are the samurai who wander Japan with no master.
