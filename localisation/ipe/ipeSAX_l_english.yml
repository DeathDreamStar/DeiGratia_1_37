 ipe_flavor_sax.4.t: "The Inheritance of Thuringia"
 ipe_flavor_sax.4.d: "After the death of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s uncle, Friedrich of Thuringia, the Thuringian Wettin lands came under the rule of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s brother, Wilhelm, who became co-ruler of Saxony. However, an argument soon broke out between the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and Wilhelm over the fair distribution of these lands. Although the [BRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Brandenburg and the [HES.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hesse have attempted to arbitrate an agreement by which the Margraviate of Meissen and the Landgraviate of Thuringia would be divided between the two brothers, Wilhelm stubbornly insists on ruling over Thuringia. If we do not acknowledge Wilhelm’s claims, he may end up waging war against us."
 ipe_flavor_sax.4.a: "Choose Thuringia."
 ipe_flavor_sax.4.a.tooltip: "§YSaxony will be partitoned and we will rule over Thuringia assuming Wilhelm does not wage war against us. Wilhelm will be more likely to wage war against us.§!"
 ipe_flavor_sax.4.b: "Choose Meissen."
 ipe_flavor_sax.4.b.tooltip: "§YSaxony will be partitioned and we will rule over Meissen assuming Wilhelm does not wage war against us. Wilhelm will be less likely to wage war against us.§!"
 ipeSAX.1.t: "The Saxon Fratricidal War"
 ipeSAX.1.d: "Wilhelm is furious at [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s decision to claim Thuringia, and in spite of the [BRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Brandenburg and the [HES.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hesse’s best attempts at arbitration, it seems that war will now begin. Wilhelm has fled to Thuringia, and gained the support of the estates there, raising an army to oppose us. Only a contest of military supremacy between brothers will decide the borders of this land."
 ipeSAX.1.a: "To arms!"
 ipeSAX.1.b: "§GPlay as Thuringia.§!"
 ipeSAX.2.t: "The Division of Altenburg"
 ipeSAX.2.d: "In part thanks to the arbitration of the [BRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Brandenburg and the [HES.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hesse, Wilhelm has begrudgingly accepted the terms of the Division of Altenburg, ceding Thuringia to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and thus becoming the ruler of Meissen instead. Peace among the Wettins has been preserved."
 ipeSAX.2.a: "All is well."
 ipeSAX.3.d: "Although we allowed Wilhelm to take control of his desired part of the Wettin inheritance, Thuringia, Wilhelm still feels cheated by the terms reached at the Division of Altenburg, and wishes to enlarge his domain at the expense of ours. Consequently, in spite of the [BRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Brandenburg and the [HES.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hesse’s best attempts at arbitration, it seems that war will now begin. Wilhelm has fled to Meissen, and gained the support of the estates there, raising an army to oppose us. Only a contest of military supremacy between brothers will decide the borders of this land."
 ipeSAX.3.b: "§GPlay as Meissen.§!"
 ipeSAX.4.d: "In part thanks to the arbitration of the [BRA.Monarch.GetTitle] of Brandenburg and the [HES.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hesse, Wilhelm has gleefully accepted the terms of the Division of Altenburg, ceding Meissen to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName], and thus becoming the ruler of Thuringia instead. Peace among the Wettins has been preserved."
