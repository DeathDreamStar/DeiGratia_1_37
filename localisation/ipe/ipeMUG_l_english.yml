 ipeMUG.1.t: "Kamran Mirza"
 ipeMUG.1.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has many sons, all of whom helped participate in the expansion of the Mughal Empire by serving as generals in various battles and campaigns. However, few are more ambitious than Kamran Mirza, who has become feared for his ruthlessness and hated for his greed. Currently governing the city of Kabul, Kamran Mirza has become a bitter rival of $HEIR$, our chosen successor. If we are to ensure the lasting stability of our realm, we must appease Kamran, possibly by offering him a division of the empire."
 ipeMUG.1.a: "We have many sons to please..."
 ipeMUG.1.a.tooltip: "§YOn the death of the current Mughal ruler, all our lands outside of India will be granted to Qamran Mirza in vassalage.§!"
 ipeMUG.1.b: "Give Kamran nothing."
 ipeMUG.1.b.tooltip: "§RKamran Mirza may revolt against us.§!"
 ipeMUG.2.t: "The Divison of the Empire"
 ipeMUG.2.d: "The $MONARCHTITLE$ is dead. As a result, $MONARCH$ has succeeded to the throne, becoming the newest ruler of the Mughal Empire. However, according to the terms he agreed to with his brother Kamran, the lands of the empire will be divided. Kamran will take custody of all Mughal lands beyond India. It remains to be seen whether Kamran will stay allegiant to the new regime."
 ipeMUG.2.a: "We will have a difficult time with him."
 ipeMUG.3.t: "Kamran Mirza's Downfall"
 ipeMUG.3.d: "In the time since Kamran Mirza was given his portion of the imperial inheritance, he has proven to be a most cruel ruler. His people accuse him of bloodlust and oppression, and have bided their time to overthrow him. At long last, the citizens of [AFG.Capital.GetCapitalName] have revolted, ousting Kamran Mirza and opening the gates of the city for the troops of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. In the meantime, Kamran Mirza has fled to the countryside, and although he may still plot rebellion against us, we are unlikely to hear of him again."
 ipeMUG.3.a: "The empire is reunited."
 ipeMUG.4.t: "Sher Shah Suri"
 ipeMUG.4.d: "Farid Khan, hailing from the Sur tribe of the Pashto, was not always a powerful man. At one time, he was but a humble private serving in the lowest ranks of the Mughal army, being simply one among many. In the time since then, however, he has gained incredible renown, earning the name Sher Khan, tiger, for allegedly slaying a tiger that leapt upon the King of Bihar. He was appointed the Governor of Bihar for his valor, and played an important role in helping us conquer the lands of Bengal.\n\nIn the absence of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ from Bengal however, Sher Khan has opted to use his army against us, defeating all our forces in the region, and laying the groundwork for what appears to be the beginning of a new great empire to the west. Observers have titled it the Sur Empire. While Sher Shah’s name is already known far and wide, few know what will become of him and his conquests."
 ipeMUG.4.a: "He is a worthy opponent."
 ipeMUG.4.a.tooltip: "§YUpon capturing the capital of Sur, the war can be ended by decision.§!"

 ipeMUG.5.t: "The Fall of the Suri Empire"
 ipeMUG.5.d: "After an extremely hard-fought campaign across India, Mughal armies have finally captured the capital of the Suri Empire at [SUR.Capital.GetCapitalName]. Thanks to our excellent generalship and the resilience of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, we have at long last brought our grueling conflict with the Suri Empire to an end. Although much of India has been left in ruins, we have shown the world that the strength of our dynasty is not in question."
 ipeMUG.5.a: "Sher Shah has taught us much."
 ipeMUG.5.a.tooltip: "§GThe lands of the Suri Empire will be reincorporated into the Mughal Empire.§!"
 ipeMUG.6.t: "The Victory of the Suri Empire"
 ipeMUG.6.d: "To the shock of the world, the Suri Empire has triumphed decisively over the Mughals, thanks to a brilliant campaign across northern India led by the likes of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. The Mughals have fled India entirely, becoming refugees in faraway lands, perhaps never to return. However, we are left with the task of rebuilding the war-torn north of India, including the reestablishment of the Grand Trunk Road. Nonetheless, the world now knows the greatness of the Suri dynasty."
 ipeMUG.6.a: "May they never return."
 ipeMUG.6.a.tooltip: "§GAll Mughal lands in India will be incorporated into the Suri Empire.§!"
 ipeMUG.7.d: "To the shock of the world, the Suri Empire has triumphed decisively over us, thanks to a brilliant campaign across northern India led by the likes of [SUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [SUR.Monarch.GetName]. We have been forced to flee India entirely, and $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has become a refugee in $CAPITAL$. It remains in question whether we will ever be able to return to India. While the Suri Empire rejoices in what they believe to be their victory, we must bide our time in order to strike back and retake our lost lands…"
 ipeMUG.7.a: "Their days are numbered!"
 ipeMUG.7.a.tooltip: "§RAll Mughal lands in India will be incorporated into the Suri Empire.§!"
 ipeMUG.8.t: "The Revolt of the Gujarat Sultanate"
 ipeMUG.8.d: "In the wake of the uprising of the Suri Empire, the people of Gujarat have rallied around a new Sultan, who promises to bring them independence from us. As a result, we now have a major uprising on our hands in Gujarat, which we will need to defeat as we deal with the Suri Empire. If we falter, other Indian kingdoms may begin to make designs upon our remaining territories."
 ipeMUG.8.a: "This is getting dangerous."
 ipeMUG.8.a.tooltip: "§YUpon capturing the capital of Gujarat, the war can be ended by decision.§!"
 ipeMUG.9.t: "The Reconquest of Gujarat"
 ipeMUG.9.d: "In hopes of achieving independence from the Mughal Empire, the people of Gujarat revolted against us as soon as we were forced to wage war against Sher Shah Suri. However, we have returned to the region with our mighty armies, and brought the Gujaratis defeat in battle once again. They will not rise a second time."
 ipeMUG.9.a: "Excellent."

 ipeMUG.11.t: "Suri Succession Crisis"
 ipeMUG.11.d: "The untimely death of Sher Shah Suri has led to a desperate fight for the throne among his descendants. Many brothers of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ have risen up, fielding great armies of their own in hopes of seizing their rightful share of the brand new Suri Empire. If we do not deal with these rebellious siblings appropriately, we may be in danger of falling victim to a Mughal resurgence."
 ipeMUG.11.a: "Kill them all!"
 ipeMUG.12.t: "The Maratha Revolt"
 ipeMUG.12.d: "Ever since our forces first set foot in the lands of Maharashtra, we have always been deeply at odds with the independently minded Maratha people, who have attempted to contest our authority at every turn. A precocious young warlord by the name of Shivaji has now begun to actively stir rebellion against us, bribing Mughal officers to surrender our forts to him whilst leading his fellow Marathas on raids throughout the region, looting and creating lawlessness wherever he goes.\n\nAlthough we have been able to minimize the damage caused by these raids, Shivaji has continued to gain momentum, and with it, ambition. He has now declared himself the [MAR.Monarch.GetTitle] of the Marathas, and pledges to make war upon our glorious empire, vowing to carve from it a nation even more powerful. Several cities and princes have already declared their allegiance to Shivaji, and war is now well underway, as Shivaji’s cry for bloodshed has become a dagger thrusted at the heart of the Mughal Empire. If our mighty nation is to survive the Maratha uprising, we must defeat Shivaji once and for all."
 ipeMUG.12.a: "India only knows one $MONARCHTITLE$."
 ipeMUG.12.b: "§GPlay as Maratha.§!"
 ipeMUG.13.t: "The Misl Confederacy"
 ipeMUG.13.d: "We have never gotten along well with our Sikh subjects in Punjab. For centuries since our conquest of Northern India, we have had to deal with the growth of their influence and privileges. While we may not have always agreed with their gurus, we have always tried to make peace with them, for they inhabit one of the richest regions of all Hindustan. In spite of the deep tensions between our regime and the Sikhs, the Sikh community has refrained from resorting to violence against us, faithfully following the pacifistic tenets of their religion. \n\nHowever, this situation has begun to change. We have made several new attempts at curbing the power and authority of the gurus, hoping to minimize Sikh autonomy and expand the authority of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ over their community. Unfortunately, the Sikhs have become gravely offended over our latest attempts to take control, and are now resorting to violence and bloodshed to make clear their desire to achieve an independent national life. The twelve Misls of Punjab now move as one, forming one powerful army known as the Dal Khalsa. With the situation rapidly spiraling out of control, we must march our armies into Punjab with great urgency, and take back the pearl of the Mughal Empire before it is lost to the Sikh armies forever."
 ipeMUG.13.a: "We shall teach them their place!"
 ipeMUG.13.b: "§GPlay as Punjab.§!"
