 KSB_ideas_bonus: "Polish Ducal Ambition"
 KSB_idea_1: "Testament of Boleslaw Wrymouth"
 KSB_idea_1_desc: "The 1138 will of Boleslaw III, called 'Wrymouth' for his deformed jaw, divided the recently-strengthened Kingdom of Poland amongst his sons. It was from this division that all polish Duchies emerged, setting in motion centuries of internal conflicts and intrigues. We owe our existence to Boleslaw's vision."
 KSB_idea_2: "Ethnic Backgrounds"
 KSB_idea_2_desc: "Before the unification of Poland into one Christian state, there were Slavic tribal units in its present lands. The Silesians, Mazovians, Vistulans, Polans, and Pomeranians were the main powers, and they each live on now in the names of our duchies. Though the distinctions have blurred, we are essentially nominal ethnostates."
 KSB_idea_3: "The Seniorate"
 KSB_idea_3_desc: "Boleslaw's testament didn't just divide Poland - it decreed a system of hierarchy, with one province centered on Kraków known as the 'Seniorate', as it was always ruled by the oldest heir and had nominal suzerainty of the other states. To push our interests, we could perhaps bend these rules and find some claim to senior privileges ourselves."
 KSB_idea_4: "Ties With the Germans"
 KSB_idea_4_desc: "Poland's interaction with the German Holy Roman Empire was extensive, though obviously strongest in the east and south. The Silesian duchies entered into a vassal relationship with Bohemia, while the Pomeranians joined the Empire as well under the influence of Brandenburg. These ties mean our royal houses have extensively intermarried, and our trade relations are tight."
 KSB_idea_5: "Divide for Appanage"
 KSB_idea_5_desc: "After the original division of Poland, the sub-duchies were again divided into even smaller territories. Kujavia emerged from Mazovia, Greater Poland produced Kalisz, Gniezno, and various smaller states. In the end, the smaller dukes had less power projection but could more closely administer their lands."
 KSB_idea_6: "Magdeburg Law"
 KSB_idea_6_desc: "The Magdeburg Laws were perhaps the most important in medieval European administration, dealing with the autonomy and rights of individual cities. Under these laws, Poland was urbanized with more modern infrastructure and thousands of villages were founded. Even major preexisting cities like Poznan benefited from the introduction of these laws."
 KSB_idea_7: "Janusz Mazowiecki"
 KSB_idea_7_desc: "Janusz III was the last of the Piast dukes to rule in Poland before being subsumed into the Royal realm. Despite his death, the duchy retained autonomy under its rebellious nobles under 1576, when it was fully integrated by the Jagiellons. We must ensure that our state maintains its own freedoms, and that ambitious monarchs will not bend us to their will."

 GLC_idea4: "The Fur Trade"
 GLC_idea4_desc: "Salt is not the only good available to us for trade, as the many furs that arrive to us from the east are in high demand on the European market. These new trade routes for fur as well as the recently introduced commerce of fish ensure our goods will reach faraway lands, increasing our renown considerably."
 GLC_idea5: "Kazani Raids"
 GLC_idea5_desc: "As open war broke out between the principalities of Russia and the Kazan Khanate to the east, the lands of Galich were subjected to heavy damage because of the Kazani incursions into the region. However, thanks to our newly erected fortifications, they will never be able to take the city itself."
 GLC_idea6: "Orthodox Monasteries"
 GLC_idea6_desc: "Many monasteries dot the landscape in and around Galich. The most noteworthy one among them remains the Paisiev Monastery, founded in the early 14th century, featuring a 16th-century five-domed cathedral, and a three-domed church from 1642. It is thanks to these wonderful monasteries that our people feel united in their faith."
 GLC_idea7: "On the Offensive"
 GLC_idea7_desc: "With the Kazan threat neutralized, the importance of Galich as a defensive position declined. Nonetheless, this has not resulted in a loss of importance for us, and even though we are now safer from invasion than before, we deem it fundamental to set up a strong army capable of taking the fight to the enemy."

Edigu, one of our more well known leaders, was himself of Manghit origin on his father's side and of Jochid origin on his mother's side, giving him more legitimacy in the eyes of the Nogai people. The Manghits are thus not only inspirational, they have legitimized themselves within the region and within the Nogai tribes."

 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "We can almost see the problems coming on the horizon, for our spread out population will undoubtedly lead to administrative issues later on. The Nogai people in different areas with little to no communication to a central authority of the Nogai Horde will be on their own, subjects to whomever comes through and seizes power. We simply can't allow this to happen; there must be communication and access throughout our lands so that we can relay information to the furthest ends of our realm with ease."

 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "Though we are technically Islamic in our foundation, there are little in the way of mosques or other formal worshipping places throughout our land. Thus, if one travels across Nogai territory, they might not even realize that its people and its administration are Islamic, making us inadvertently more tolerant to both heretics and heathens."

 khanate_rivalries_desc: "There are several petty khans in the vast Eurasian steppe that claim authority with what little military forces they control.

Although the Ethiopians have yet to become capable of enforcing their will upon the Muslim dynasties of Egypt, the acknowledgement that Ethiopia is among the last Christian kingdoms in the east fuels a great religious fervor within the people. The people of Ethiopia are posed to resist Islam and the malign influences of all other foreign faiths."
 prester_john: "Prester John"
 prester_john_desc: "While it has never been a title of the Negusa Nagast, Western Christians have bestowed the title of \"Prester John\" upon successive rulers of Ethiopia. Allegedly, they view Ethiopia to be the long-heralded and mighty Christian kingdom that they have always suspected to exist in the East, beyond the frontiers of their known world. However absurd this tale may sound to the people of our humble nation, we can use the mysticism and prestige surrounding the legend of Prester John to raise our image in the eyes of the European Christians, who may become useful allies."

The mountains and rivers make for nearly impassable terrain entrances into Janjiro land and it is because of this isolation that we can administrate the land much better than other places.

We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."

Though we are family, that does not mean there are not familial tensions between us and often times this has broken out into revolts against our authority in the past.

 from_the_tiele_desc: "The Bashkirs date back to the times of the anciete Tiele, a confederation of nomadic tribes that emerged after the ancient Xiongnu confederation of tribes broke up entirely. With such an ancient lineage, we are able to earn respect and honor amongst our neighbors who also recount stories from so long ago."
 sunni_horde_conquest: "Sunni Conquests"
 sunni_horde_conquest_desc: "Much like our neighbors down south, except for perhaps the Persians, conquest by Sunni states is something that almost comes naturally. Despite sayings of piety and religious doctrine here and there, the steppe know few such laws in reality and the Bashkirs will readily take advantage of both this fact and the legacy of Sunni Muslims conquering great swaths of land in the name of Islam and for themselves."

 holders_for_centuries_desc: "For centuries we have resided where we are, not budging and remaining resolute despite what is thrown at us.

 turkic_language_intelligibility_desc: "Our language is mutually intelligible with several other Turkic languages to a degree, and while we can't understand every single thing our cousins say to us, the fact that we can understand a good amount between us goes a long way toward acceptance and tolerance. The more Turkic kin we come into contact with, the better!"
 bashkir_military_tradition: "Bashkir Military Traditions"
 bashkir_military_tradition_desc: "The militarized mentality of the Bashkirs should not be wasted in the slightest. The zeal with which our people fight when defending the land and when they are among the conquering forces of a different land is unparalleled. We should utilize this zeal for more concrete purposes such as expanding the military sector as a whole and ensuring that it has the best possible chance for success against our enemies."
 traditional_steppe_warfare: "Traditional Steppe Warfare"
 traditional_steppe_warfare_desc: "Despit the introduction of firearms, we still prefer the old ways of cavalry armies and tactics. Bashkirs know just how devastating a cavalry charge along with ranged cavalry tactics can be, especially on the wide open steppe, which is why we still utilize them to this day. In any flat terrain setting, our forces will be sure to have the edge against our foes."
 a_formal_bashkir_military: "Formalize the Fighting Force"
 a_formal_bashkir_military_desc: "With such a strong and grand military foundation, the logical next step is to formalize and standardize the Bashkirs into a fully capable fighting force on par with our neighbors. They may think the Bashkirs can't field that large of an army from the lands of the steppe, but we will prove them wrong."

 fall_of_the_golden_horde_desc: "With the fall of the Golden Horde to the west, power in Central Asia is scattered and people are looking for strong leadership wherever it presents itself.

 rivals_to_our_east_desc: "The east was home to the Chagatai and the Great Yuan, but now there merely hollow remnants in their place.

 expanding_our_internal_domain_desc: "Within the lands of the Kazakh, there are those who obey the leaders with little question, and those who hear very little from the leaders at all.

 modernize_our_tactics_desc: "Time and time again, we are seeing the tactics of old run into issues against the modern weapons used predominantly by Europeans and those they trade with. Perhaps investing time and effort into modernization efforts for our military could yield positive results; our old tactics may be kept in books and documents for future use, but if the Kazakh military is to keep itself afloat, there must be some effort to reform and the military itself."

 islam_and_shamanism_desc: "We are by far the northern-most political entity in which Islam is the dominant religion, but we must realize that indigenous Shamanist beliefs of the northern people are prominent within our domain. We must not be so readily discriminatory toward them as that will only bring about instability to the entire realm; rather, we should be tolernat and understanding to them, slowly coercing them to being one with Islam over time."

 interconnected_mongol_dynasties_desc: "Throughout the many lands that the once might Mongol Empire conquered, the descendants are now split into several different but still related dynasties. Even we in the far north are connected to this web of dynastic descendants and it is because of this that we can easily enforce our authority over the lands we conquer throughout the steppe and beyond."

 forest_fighting_methods_desc: "The nature of fighting in the far north has made us change our tactics somewhat from how the steppe hordes would normally do combat. Because of the dense forests of the far north, we are more adept at breaking huge cavalry charges and breaking down general shock tactics that some would be used to."

 friends_of_the_baloch_desc: "Few talk of the people of the Baloch for some reason or another; perhaps it is because they are seen as tribal and unworthy? We don't know for sure, but what we do know is that our citizens have made great friends in the people of the Baloch and many mercenary contracts are coming through to Multan from the region because of this. Why not cement this friendship further and accept the mercenaries into our fold?"

 kashmir_shaivisim_history_desc: "Perhaps a sect of Buddhism or Hinduism, outsiders would call it, but Kashmir Shaivism has been around for our people since the mid-9th century AD.

With Syria in a prime position to take hold of the entirety of the Levant, we are set to be in a prime position for negotiations in the future.

The bastions they built up along with the conflicts they fought in the Levant and on Syrian land are remembered well by our people, but our people would be fools to only tell the tales of the crusades and not learn from them.

 SZK_idea3: "Széks"
 SZK_idea3_desc: "The Székely administrative units were known as széks (or seats) from the middle of the 14th century. Each seat was headed by two elected officials, the lieutenant (maior exercitus) and the seat judge (iudex terrestris). Theoretically, lieutenants were responsible for the military affairs and seat judges administered justice, but lieutenants also heard legal disputes. Both seat judges and lieutenants heard disputes together with twelve jurors."
 SZK_idea4: "Resisting Centralization"
 SZK_idea4_desc: "Stephen Báthory, Voivode of Transylvania and Count of the Székelys, made several attempts to reduce the autonomy of the seats in the early 1490s, accusing many primores of high treason. He confiscated their estates and forced Székely heiresses to marry his retainers. Fortunately, through perseverance and persuasion, we have convinced the King of Hungary to replace this troublesome official. This precedent well shows us that the path to lasting prosperity lies in the pen as much as it does in the sword."

To remedy this, we should found a main port on what coastline we have, so that our nation can participate in commerce across the Cote d'Argent."
 ABT_mad_war: "The Mad War"
 ABT_mad_war_desc: "The Mad War was one of the defining points of our history, when in 1485 the Lord of Albret, Alain the Great, attempted to take control of the Duchy of Brittany through marriage. The resulting war was a valiant rebellion against the French monarchy, but was quickly put down, with the Duchess of Brittany marrying the king of France instead. While the war was a defeat, we can learn from our shortcomings and build a more resilient army."

 ABT_gascon_connections_desc: "Albret shares its history with the collection of states that once made up the region of Gascony. Albret is one of the few polities that still survives in spite of Anglo-French warfare in Gascony throughout the centuries. With our close proximity to major cities such as Bordeaux, we can establish strong connections with them to benefit our economy."

 ABT_the_last_fiefdom_desc: "The appanages under the control of the House of Albret continued to remain subordinate, but not fully integrated, into the royal domain until 1572. At this time, the House of Albret had expanded significantly, acquiring great holdings in the south of France, including the Kingdom of Navarre."

 ABT_landes_forest_desc: "The forests which once dominated the landscape around Albret have now been all but depleted due to deforestation. However, if we were to usher in new development projects to create a new pine plantation, our economy and industry would considerably improve."

 KTZ_idea_1_desc: "The origin of the name 'Katzenelnbogen' has not been finally clarified. It could go back to the Latin name 'Cattimelibocus'. 'Catti' refers to the Germanic peoples of the Chatti, the modern Hessians, while 'Melibocus' means mountain or mountain range. No matter where our name comes from, it has nothing to do with cats nor their elbows, or so we'd like to believe."

 SRU_idea_5_desc: "In 1374, the ruler of Saruhan had the Great Mosque (Ulu Camii) of Manisa built, whose prayer hall is crowned by a 14-meter wide dome. The building served as a model for the Üç-?erefeli mosque, which was built 60 years later by the Ottoman Sultan Murad II. In the future it will be easier for our master builders and architects to design and build such impressive buildings."
 SRU_idea_6: "Reconstruction of Byzantine Defences"
 SRU_idea_6_desc: "The region around Manisa was devastated by repeated looting by the Turks in the 13th century. The city walls and citadels built by the Byzantines were destroyed.

 AYD_idea_2: "The Pirate Port of Smyrna"
 AYD_idea_2_desc: "In 1329 our forces finally captured the port of Smyrna from the Genoese. Ever since that fated year we have been pirating and raiding Latin trade routes all across the Aegean, causing much grief for our infidel enemies"
 AYD_idea_3: "Cooperation with the Romans"
 AYD_idea_3_desc: "In 1335, great Emir Umer Bey Aydinoglu formed an alliance with Emperor John Cantacuzenus of the Romans against Venice, Genoa and the Knights of St John, which brought peace and stability to the region for several years. We even lent soldiers and ships to the Emperor, who wanted to recapture Lesbos from Genoa."
 AYD_idea_4: "The Legacy of Umer Bey, Lion of God"

 AYD_idea_5: "Büyük Menderes River"
 AYD_idea_5_desc: "The Büyük Menderes River is a river in western Asia Minor that is also called 'Maeander' because of its many twists and turns. It flows through the territory of Aydin and allows us to thoroughly irrigate our agriculture, heightening our production of crops."
 AYD_idea_6: "Major Grain Supplier"
 AYD_idea_6_desc: "The area of Aydin is of great importance as a grain supplier. So much so that in 1379, Pope Clement VII had to allow the Knights of Rhodes to buy grain from us, because hunger forced them to do so."
 AYD_idea_7: "Experienced Shipbuilders"

 MEN_idea_2: "Hinterland of Caria"
 MEN_idea_2_desc: "Mentese is located in the hinterland of Caria, which is mostly mountainous and hilly, crossed by smaller rivers. Agriculture is not possible in the mountains, which is why it is limited to a few plains and estuaries. However, since antiquity the coast of Caria is of great importance for trade, as several inland roads converge here."
 MEN_idea_3: "Rule over Rhodes"
 MEN_idea_3_desc: "At the beginning of the 14th century, the island of Rhodes was under our great rule. Around 1310, it was conquered by the Knights of St. John with the help of the French king. Attempts have been made by not only our Beylik but by our other Turkish kin as well, but to no avail. In order to restore our prestige we must recapture Rhodes and build a great navy!"
 MEN_idea_4: "Wealthy Trading State"

 MOE_idea_1: "This is Sparta"
 MOE_idea_1_desc: "The core of the Despotate of Morea in its original 1349 foundation was around the southern Peloponnese, where the ruins of ancient Sparta lay. Sparta has been famed throughout the West in all ages for its unparalleled warrior-cult society and its steadfastness in the wars with Achaemenid Persia. Embracing our old heritage will inspire fear in our enemies."
 MOE_idea_2: "The Kantakouzenoi"
 MOE_idea_2_desc: "Morea was created as an appanage for the sons of successive Byzantine emperors, and as such it was first granted to Manuel Kantakouzenos, scion of then-ruler John VI. The Kantakouzenoi were one of the most wealthy and powerful families among all the Greek peoples since the times of the Komnenoi and many later families of Eastern Europe trace their lineage to them."
 MOE_idea_3: "Invite Albanian Settlers"
 MOE_idea_3_desc: "One of the innovations of Theodoros Palaiologos was to invite Albanians to settle the Peloponnese in an attempt to mitigate its population and manpower decline. These Greco-Albanians were part of the larger ethnic group known as Arvanites or Arbanites."
 MOE_idea_4: "Isthmus of Corinth"
 MOE_idea_4_desc: "This tiny natural land bridge is all that links the Peloponnesian peninsula to mainland Greece and Europe. It is an incredible defensive advantage that allows our state to be virtually immune to land invasion."
 MOE_idea_5: "Feudal Divisions"
 MOE_idea_5_desc: "In the late Palaiologan era, Morea became divided between co-ruling sons, such as Demetrios and Thomas Palaiologos. Though the pair were unpopular and suffered a major peasant revolt, the idea of turning Morea into Theme-like locally-ruled titles is not a bad one."
 MOE_idea_6: "Restore the Haxamilion"
 MOE_idea_6_desc: "In 1446 Murad II, Sultan of the Ottoman Turks, dismantled the realm's most important defensive bulwark, the Hexamilion Wall, which straddled the Isthmus of Corinth and ensured that no hostile armies would pass through it. We should gather together all the stone and masons we can to restore this great wall of the Morea!"
 MOE_idea_7: "Monemvasia"
 MOE_idea_7_desc: "The Morea's greatest advantages are all in its natural geography, and Monemvasia is no different. At the tip of a sharp peninsula on the larger Peloponnese, Monemvasia can be used as an easily-defensible port and was indeed the only part of the whole region held onto by the Byzantines after the Fourth Crusade in 1204."

 PAR_idea_2: "Orlando 'del Rosso'"
 PAR_idea_2_desc: "For over two hundred years, Parma was under the thumb of the de' Rossi family.

 PAR_idea_5: "Pope Paul III"
 PAR_idea_5_desc: "The Farnese family of Parma, a powerful force in Renaissance Italy, had inroads into Latium that paid off during the counter-reformation when Alessandro Farnese ascended to the Papacy as Paul III. His pontificate was colored by rich artistic patronage, the popularization of Roman Catholic religious orders such as the Jesuits, and the convention of the famous Council of Trent."
 PAR_idea_6: "Guillaume du Tillot"
 PAR_idea_6_desc: "It seems unusual for a Frenchman to be tied to the fortune of an Italian city, but Parma flourished under the administration of the French politician Léon Guillaume du Tillot.

 MOD_idea_2: "Canto delle Scolte Modenesi"
 MOD_idea_2_desc: "In the ninth century, a nameless poet wrote a haunting lyric poem about the guards of Modena's city walls. These guardsmen were facing brutal attacks from the Magyar raiders and the poem's encouragement was a welcome gesture."
 MOD_idea_3: "University of Modena"
 MOD_idea_3_desc: "It is often claimed that the University of Bologna is the oldest in Europe, but of course everyone knows that the University of Modena was founded several decades earlier in 1175! We cannot let this plainly obvious mistake go uncorrected!"
 MOD_idea_4: "House of Este"
 MOD_idea_4_desc: "The margraves of Este north of nearby Ferrara took power in Modena starting in 1288, and after some interludes of revolution maintained power for centuries afterward. This illustrious dynasty was descended from the Obertenghi, the supreme power of northwest Italy in the Middle Ages."
 MOD_idea_5: "Build the Ducal Palace"
 MOD_idea_5_desc: "Duke Francesco I started construction of the ducal palace of Modena in the mid 1600s after the family's original seat, Ferrara, was lost to the Papacy. The imposing baroque structure commands the city at the site of an ancient castle."
 MOD_idea_6: "Mary of Modena"
 MOD_idea_6_desc: "A scion of house Este, Mary became queen consort of England and Scotland when she married James II Stuart. When the family was deposed by the Glorious Revolution in 1688, she became a 'queen in exile' in France. Despite this sad turn of events, Modena clearly has rich diplomatic connections."
 MOD_idea_7: "Integrate the Jews"
 MOD_idea_7_desc: "Since the 1300s Jewish communities have populated Modena, though often living in poverty within their ghetto. In 1775, however, the Duke decided to allow Jews to attend the University of Modena and soon they had civic rights as well under the French provisional government established in the 1790s."

 JAI_idea_2: "Tas-Silg"
 JAI_idea_2_desc: "Tas-Silg is the name of a hill which commands Marsaxlokk Bay on the southern coast of Malta. It was the site of a Byzantine monastery which became heavily fortified in the eighth century due to the threat of Muslim raids."
 JAI_idea_3: "Arabic Influences"
 JAI_idea_3_desc: "The Maltese language is a curious one. About half its vocabulary is Italian, but another third is made up of Arabic, as is the grammatical structure. Though it is scarcely mutually intelligible with Maghrebi Arabic, the Islamic presence on the island is unforgettable and lives on to the present."
 JAI_idea_4: "Great Siege of Malta"
 JAI_idea_4_desc: "The 1565 siege of Malta by the Ottoman Empire is perhaps the most famous siege of the Early Modern west. 40,000 Ottoman troops under the pirate Dragut surrounded the island and spent three months trying to take its fortress, defended by the Knights Hospitaller's 6,000 men. The Knights' general Jean de Valette managed to withstand the siege against all odds, destroying the image of Ottoman invincibility and later getting the capital city named after himself. Voltaire once claimed 'nothing is better known than the siege of Malta.'"
 JAI_idea_5: "Noria"
 JAI_idea_5_desc: "The relatively brief period of Islamic rule in Malta produced a profound effect on the local agriculture, as irrigation infrastructure like waterwheels (noria) were created and new crops such as cotton, oranges, and lemons were planted."
 JAI_idea_6: "Ir-Rewwixta tal-Qassisin"
 JAI_idea_6_desc: "The 'Rising of the Priests' was an incident in 1775 when the clergy of Malta rose up against the decadent and declining Knights Hospitaller and took over two of the island's important forts, Fort Saint Elmo and Saint James Cavalier. Though it was put down, it proved the populace would not stand for tyranny and poverty."
 JAI_idea_7: "The Maltese Falcon"
 JAI_idea_7_desc: "Legend holds that in the 1500s, as a reward for the continued support of the King of Spain, the Knights Hospitaller created a solid-gold statue of a falcon encrusted with jewels. This artifact is priceless and is the object of many adventurers' journeys. We must tear apart every vault of Malta to find it!"

 ANC_idea_2: "Stamira"
 ANC_idea_2_desc: "The siege of 1173 was the most dramatic in Ancona's history. Surrender was almost guaranteed as a large Venetian fleet blockaded the port and an Imperial army under Christian of Mainz besieged the walls. However, a patriotic woman named Stamira sallied from the walls and sacrificed herself by lighting pitch on fire to rout the attackers."
 ANC_idea_3: "Adriatic Renaissance"
 ANC_idea_3_desc: "The Adriatic Sea saw close connections forged between major cities like Ancona, Venice, Zara, Ragusa, and Rimini. A rediscovery of classical art, fused with the existing Gothic style, characterized the so-called 'Adriatic Renaissance' which spread between these cities in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries."
 ANC_idea_4: "Republicanism"
 ANC_idea_4_desc: "Unlike most of the cities under nominal Papal sovereignty, Ancona never developed into a hereditary seigniory ruled by a strongman. Only a brief conquest by the Malatesta from 1348-1383 marred its record."
 ANC_idea_5: "Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli"
 ANC_idea_5_desc: "In 1391 Ancona was the birthplace of the famous Italian antiquarian Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli, dubbed the father of archaeology. He compiled his observations trading in the East in a six-volume Commentaria, and was even present under Ottoman employment at the 1422 siege of Constantinople."
 ANC_idea_6: "Jewish Rights"
 ANC_idea_6_desc: "In 1569 the Papacy banned the Jews from its lands with the exception of three cities - Rome itself, Avignon, and Ancona, where they could live in ghettos. Prior to attempted Papal persecutions in 1555, the Jewish community in Ancona numbered at 2,700."
 ANC_idea_7: "Confraternita dei Greci"
 ANC_idea_7_desc: "Due to our close historical ties with Byzantium, including sworn allegiance to the Komnenid Emperors, Ancona was also home to a significant Greek Orthodox minority.

 HIL_idea_1_desc: "Dammstadt, located not too far from Hildesheim, grew from Hildesheimer trade. The city became increasingly powerful, gaining city rights, city walls and a real market place. It even started making new settlements; the city was our economic rival and most annoyingly, had even tried to influence the elections in Hildesheim. It became a real threat in the eyes of the Bishops. In 1331-1332, a double election happened, where the candidate supported by Dammstadt was ousted, and his successor prompted an attack against Dammstadt on Christmas Eve 1332, in which it got looted and mostly destroyed. The remains of the city were integrated into the city of Hildesheim."
 HIL_idea_2: "Innerste Ford"
 HIL_idea_2_desc: "The city of Hildesheim, one of the oldest in Northern Germany, had an important market on the Hellweg trade route, as it secured the Innerste ford. The fact that the city had a cathedral, and an important market, made it grow to be one of the largest cities in Northern Germany in 1250. The first market place was laid out around the church St. Andreas. When the city grew further, a bigger market place became necessary."
 HIL_idea_3: "Tausendjähriger Rosenstock"
 HIL_idea_3_desc: "The Tausendjähriger Rosenstock, or Thousand-year Rose, is a rosa canina that climbs on the wall of Hildesheim Cathedral. It is probably the rose mentioned in a legend in the Fundatio Ecclesiae Hildensemens, an 11th-century publication. The Emperor had taken a reliquary to use when he stopped to say Mass while out hunting. The artefact was placed in a tree while the sermon was undertaken but not retrieved when the hunt resumed. Later a chaplain was unable to remove the reliquary from the branches. Believing this to be a symbol of God's will, the Emperor had a church constructed there instead of as originally planned at Elze."
 HIL_idea_4: "High Reputation Cathedral Chapter"
 HIL_idea_4_desc: "The reputation of the cathedral chapter and school was such that Hildesheim produced no fewer than forty-four bishops and archbishops, who served in dioceses from Cologne to Magdeburg and from Schleswig to Salzburg and Brixen, between 918 and 1167."
 HIL_idea_5: "Flourishing in the Ottonian Era"
 HIL_idea_5_desc: "Hildesheim gained a lot of power and prosperity during the Ottonian era. A cultural revival spurred, as sovereigns and bishops, seeking the prestige of the Roman and Byzantine empires, vigorously supported the production of art, especially illuminated manuscripts and their jeweled covers, fine metalwork, and other luxury church furnishings. It was under the Ottonian kings that Hildesheim was elevated to the dynasty's home bishopric, and the proximity to them brought the Bishops numerous privileges, including the right to mint coinage. It is during this period that medieval Hildesheim produced a massive amount of art."
 HIL_idea_6: "Hildesheim Diocesan Feud"
 HIL_idea_6_desc: "The Hildesheim Diocesan Feud was a conflict that broke out between Hildesheim and Brunswick. Due to the Prince-Bishopric's poor financial circumstances he asked for the return of several estates pledged to the nobles within the realm but some of them refused to give up their mortgaged property. The ruler of Brunswick sought a reason to attack neighboring Hildesheim and found one in the disputes between the prince-bishop and the nobility; thus he started a war. Hildesheim won a major battle at Soltau that could've made them win the war, but the Emperor, favoring Brunswick, used its influence and Hildesheim had to give up a lot of territory. They perhaps won militarily, but not politically."
 HIL_idea_7: "Hildesheimer Treasure"
 HIL_idea_7_desc: "The Hildesheim Treasure, unearthed on October 17 1868 in Hildesheim by Prussian soldiers, is the largest collection of Roman silver found outside imperial frontiers. Most of it can be dated to the 1st century AD, and was probably produced in frontier workshops of the Northwestern Roman provinces. The trove consists of about seventy exquisitely crafted solid silver vessels for eating and drinking. It is generally believed that the treasure was the table service of a Roman commander, perhaps Publius Quintilius Varus, who was militarily active in Germania. However, others also suggest that the treasure may have been war spoils rather than a table service."

 CHP_ideas_start: "Champagnian Traditions"
 CHP_ideas_bonus: "Champagnian Ambition"
 CHP_idea_1: "Royal Seneschals"
 CHP_idea_1_desc: "All courtiers in the French royal court had to obey a seneschal: he also administered royal domains and replaced the King in many matters when he was absent. Such great power in the Kingdom of France was hereditary to counts of Champagne: now one of the contestants for the throne in Paris. Our past gives us great knowledge in civil matters and administration."
 CHP_idea_2: "Champagnian Independence"
 CHP_idea_2_desc: "It is imperative for us to know that we were nearly an independent county; we definitely have the most experience in how to be sovereign rulers, and it shows."
 CHP_idea_3: "Champagne Fairs"
 CHP_idea_3_desc: "In latter days Champagnian fairs were a main contributor to abundance and prosperity in Champagne. Incorporation of Champagne into France made them lose their importance. We are independent, for now, and should strive to make cities like Provins and Brie full of Italian merchants again."
 CHP_idea_4: "Battle of Chalons"
 CHP_idea_4_desc: "It is on our ground where Hunnic hordes were stopped and crushed by Aetius, the Last Roman. We are proud to host such sacred ground, and we are bound to learn from Romans about their tactics and strategy, which saved Europe from utter destruction."
 CHP_idea_5: "Cathedral of Reims"
 CHP_idea_5_desc: "In the cathedral in our capital the Kings of France had to be crowned, and that gives us a great advantage in uniting the shattered country - we already have the required place of coronation. While our architects and engineers work on strengthening its defence, we should learn how to strengthen the ties between duchies that will bow to us when we unite France."
 CHP_idea_6: "Thibaut the Troubadour's Chants"
 CHP_idea_6_desc: "One of the counts of Champagne and King of Navarre as well, Thibaut de Blois, was a famous crusader and poet. The Renaissance wave that arrived in our lands from Italy might cause a revolution in our arts and poetry, but his call to holy war will never be drowned out:\n'Qui n'a en soi pitié ni souvenance,\nAu haut Seigneur doit chercher sa vengeance,\nEt délivrer sa terre et son pays.'"
 CHP_idea_7: "Champagne"
 CHP_idea_7_desc: "Our wines were always highly prized, but one monk known as Dom Perignon was said to have invented a wine that became famous not only as the drink of royalty and great people, but also as 'the wine of civilization'; a beverage that is somewhat like a landmark of the West and its whole cultural heritage. Considering its taste... words can't describe it. Poetry merely offers a weak facsimile. One can only drink it to know what Champagne is, and through its bubbles new ideas flow into the minds of great politicians and kings. Cork pops will sign great Champagnian military victories and successes of science and diplomacy."

 AVI_ideas: "Avignonais Ideas"

 AVI_idea_1: "Sieges of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_1_desc: "The city of Avignon was sieged multiple times - first in antiquity, then the Dark Ages and the medieval period - as we are no mere village, but an important metropolis! We have learned what it means to be prepared for diseases, lack of food and water, and we will be always prepared to survive even years of siege. God helps those who help themselves..."
 AVI_idea_2: "Avignon Exchange"
 AVI_idea_2_desc: "We are prodigies in the modern-day economy: the new invention of foreign exchange markets was first established here in 1248. The Holy See used it to maintain numerable financial relations with European monarchs, but now we are free. If we restrict its use to our economic adversaries, we will quickly see their economy falter."
 AVI_idea_3: "Republic of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_3_desc: "Because of our economic importance, we once declared ourselves a republic. Short was her life: feudal lords quickly subdued us to their rule. But we never forget that small communes should have a degree of autonomy, for it makes them more willing to assimilate."
 AVI_idea_4: "University of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_4_desc: "Rejoice! A wild horde of drunkards, rascals, and easygoers can come to our city and study there! Nothing good will come of this, as every coin they pay us goes toward rebuilding what they have destroyed in their drunken rage. However, ages of dealing with students gave us experience at dealing with most unpleasant diplomats politely."
 AVI_idea_5: "Palais des Papes"
 AVI_idea_5_desc: "Let's face it: Avignon popes were not really rightful popes. Not truly independent, they marked the beginning of a schism tormenting the one true Catholic Church. The Palace of Popes (and Antipopes) is a reminder of how they used to claim things that were not quite theirs. Who said it is not useful in politics?"
 AVI_idea_6: "Bridge of Avignon"
 AVI_idea_6_desc: "Legend has it the bridge in Avignon was built by Saint Benezet. When Jesus himself told him to create a passage across the Rhone, he formed The Bridge Brotherhood to help him in construction. Recreation of this Brotherhood will enhance communication a lot."
 AVI_idea_7: "Great Schism"
 AVI_idea_7_desc: "We must remember the times when we were the seat of the spiritual ruler of half of Europe: the Pope of Avignon was supported by the kings of France, Scotland, Aragon and Castile. The time of glory will come once more, however, not by the power of the Church, but by the power of our armies and subjects."

 FRW_idea_4_desc: "For centuries, Worms has been the site of a thriving Ashkenazic Jewish community. Though the city's history is fraught with conflict and pogroms, fostering cooperation between our religions will help the city mature as a whole."
 FRW_idea_5: "Privileges of Emperor Heinrich"
 FRW_idea_5_desc: "Heinrich III Salian granted Worms considerable privileges, eventually leading to our status as a Free City. It is time we reminded the Empire of this ancient tradition of Wormser supremacy."
 FRW_idea_6: "Imperial Diets"
 FRW_idea_6_desc: "Worms has been chosen as the site of several Imperial diets and concordats, most notably the 1521 Diet of Worms which declared Martin Luther a heretic. We are thus on the forefront of political issues."
 FRW_idea_7: "Strengthen the City Walls"
 FRW_idea_7_desc: "In order for such a city as Worms to survive against powerful neighboring states, we need to keep an alert garrison and sufficient defenses at the ready. Upgrading our city walls will go a long way in establishing our sovereignty, and we'll make Speyer pay for it!"

 FIU_idea_3: "Adriatic Trade Network"
 FIU_idea_3_desc: "By creating a web of contacts and trade bases, we can hold a much more important position in Adriatic trade, competing with other merchant republics such as Venice and Ragusa."
 FIU_idea_4: "Resist the Ottomans"
 FIU_idea_4_desc: "Many times the Turks have tried to occupy our city, yet they never succeeded. If we want to preserve our city from the Turk, it is imperative that we improve our walls and fortifications."
 FIU_idea_5: "Renaissance and Baroque"
 FIU_idea_5_desc: "From the XVI century onwards, our city was largely rebuilt in the new styles coming from Italy and Europe. If we invest in creating splendid palaces and gardens, our city will be the envy of all the Adriatic."
 FIU_idea_6: "Corpus Separatum"
 FIU_idea_6_desc: "We are surrounded by large and powerful nations; if we want to preserve our freedom and independence, we must carefully handle diplomacy with the neighboring monarchies to gain their protection."
 FIU_idea_7: "Indeficienter"
 FIU_idea_7_desc: "Starting from the early XIX century, the city of Fiume underwent tremendous architectural development, modernizing the city's infrastructure and turning it into the Mediterranean's fifth most important port. This age of blossoming optimism and economic welfare is reflected in the city's motto: Indeficienter (Without End)."

 VOL_idea_1_desc: "The Bug and Dniester are highly important rivers. Trading via the Bug allows us to buy and sell products from Poland and North-East Germany. The Dniester estuary is in the Black Sea, which we can use to trade with coastal countries and Byzantium."
 VOL_idea_2: "Strong Administration"
 VOL_idea_2_desc: "The Duchy of Halych and Volhynia has developed a robust administration. Previously, the duke assembled the Duma once a year to solve the problems of the realm. Since the 14th century it had become contiBYTus and even had the power to veto the duke's laws. The country was divided into Volosts which were governed by boyars that had a seat in the Duma. There were also such jobs as Dvorskii (Butler), Pechatnik (modern-day Foreign Minister), Writer, Stolnik and many others."
 VOL_idea_3: "United Duchies"
 VOL_idea_3_desc: "Halych and Volhynia were two separate countries until Daniel of Galicia united them under his rule. This made our country second in size after Novgorod and one of the most populated nations among the Rus."
 VOL_idea_4: "Kings of the Rus"
 VOL_idea_4_desc: "In 1253 Daniel of Galicia accepted Catholic faith and was proclaimed The King of The Rus by the Pope. By accepting this title he was able to claim fallen Rus states to restore the old country."
 VOL_idea_5: "Halych Army"
 VOL_idea_5_desc: "The army of Halych consists of two parts. The first one consists of Boyars, their sons, and civil servants. They are the cavalry part of our army. The second part is ordinary soldiers. Each cavalryman needs to have exactly two unmounted warriors. This army composition allowed us to defeat the Tatars."
 VOL_idea_6: "Exiles From Other Duchies"
 VOL_idea_6_desc: "Halych and Volhynia was one of the few lands of ancient Rus that escaped the Tatar yoke. So many banished individuals arrived to our country to work and develop science and crafts."
 VOL_idea_7: "Ties with the World"
 VOL_idea_7_desc: "Our duchy has a lot of common history with neighbors. Our dukes constantly married Lithuanian and Polish women as well as other Russian states. So many dynasties have Volhynian roots in their history."

 MKL_ideas_bonus: "Mecklenburger Ambition"
 MKL_idea_1: "Stable Government"
 MKL_idea_1_desc: "While the rest of Germany is involved in their own conflicts the area of Mecklenburg is relatively stable. This owes to its remote northern position and its isolation from other major wars. Our prosperity shall serve as an example to others."
 MKL_idea_2: "Obotrite Tactics"
 MKL_idea_2_desc: "In 1160 the area of Mecklenburg, then under the Obotrite confederacy, suffered a joint invasion by Saxony and Denmark. Though they were successful in partitioning the Obotrite lands, the princes of Mecklenburg continued to fight against Saxon rule before finally being subdued. As a result our ancestors have taught us much in the ways of warfare."
 MKL_idea_3: "Innovative Agriculture"

 MKL_idea_4: "Hanseatic Center"
 MKL_idea_4_desc: "Mecklenburg's border with the Baltic Sea allows the cities along its coast to prosper from the Hanseatic trade. Let us further encourage these developments to direct more wealth to our coffers."
 MKL_idea_5: "Vast Dynastic Connections"
 MKL_idea_5_desc: "The dynasty of Mecklenburg actively pursued various claims at one point or another to the thrones of Sweden and Norway, as the dukes of Mecklenburg were descended from their monarchs. Let this be the same for all other thrones whose succession hangs in the balance."
 MKL_idea_6: "University of Rostock"
 MKL_idea_6_desc: "The University of Rostock, founded in 1419, is the oldest university in northern continental Europe, and was among the largest universities in Germany, attracting students from as far as the Low Countries."
 MKL_idea_7: "End the Partitions"
 MKL_idea_7_desc: "Mecklenburg is ideally a single state, however throughout history this has been far from the truth. We must absorb the petty breakaway duchies around us and proclaim ourselves duke of all Mecklenburg."

 SCN_ideas_bonus: "Scanian Ambition"
 SCN_idea_1: "Øresund Ports"
 SCN_idea_1_desc: "The 'Ear-Sound' is first attested in Norse writing at the turn of the second millennium. The narrow waterway commands trade between the whole Baltic Sea and the rest of the world, making its control invaluable. Scania is centered upon some of its most important ports, such as Lund and Malmø. We should use this to our advantage."
 SCN_idea_2: "Harald Bluetooth's Conquests"
 SCN_idea_2_desc: "Originally, Scania was made up of five tribal units or Thanedoms, consisting of disorganized farmers. The first Danish king Haraldr united the region in the tenth century, overseeing its Christianization. Haraldr was the greatest of Scandinavian rulers, and a great asset to the true faith. Now that we have regained our independence, we Scanians should model our society after his vision!"
 SCN_idea_3: "Scanian Law"
 SCN_idea_3_desc: "Encoded at the turn of the thirteenth century, Scanian Law is the oldest provincial law code in Denmark. Within the vernacular manuscript were laws regarding property, farming, fishing, criminal justice, marriage, heritage, common land, and more. We can further cement these laws by producing a Runic edition, a 'Codex Runicus', in this most ancient language of our fathers."
 SCN_idea_4: "Found the Lund Academy"
 SCN_idea_4_desc: "In 1425 a Franciscan monastery in Lund opened a university, dubbed 'the Academy'. Though it was eventually shut down in the wake of the reformation, it contributed greatly to the scholasticism of the region. In 1666, a spiritual successor was established in the form of the Regia Academia Caroline, which continued to educate Scania's citizens."
 SCN_idea_5: "Dominium Maris Baltici"
 SCN_idea_5_desc: "Establishing a Baltic Sea Dominion over the sea's entire coastline is the goal of all Scandinavian rulers. Due to its crucial position on the borderland between Denmark and Sweden, Scania has seen many battles on land and sea, and was endlessly fought over by foreign powers. Now that we have learned from these various attempted invasions, we can realize our own aspirations of dominance."
 SCN_idea_6: "Loyal Protestants"
 SCN_idea_6_desc: "Like most of Scandinavia, Scania abandoned the Church of Rome and decided to instead follow the teachings of Martin Luther. While continental Europe was rocked by endless pogroms and revolts, Scania was quite unified in its religious views."
 SCN_idea_7: "Resist Swedification"
 SCN_idea_7_desc: "The Swedes have desperately tried to stamp out Scanian culture, depriving us of our history and our dialect. We must resist their imperialistic advances and ensure our culture survives."

 LVA_idea_1: "Varangian Trade Route"
 LVA_idea_1_desc: "The Greeks call it 'Emporike Odos Varangos-Hellenon', their main trade route with the Norse Varangians. The rivers of Livonia are a crucial part of this route, leading from the Baltic to the Kievan Rus and eventually Byzantium. We can thus exact tolls on travelers and hold an important role in Eastern geopolitics."
 LVA_idea_2: "Amber Deposits"
 LVA_idea_2_desc: "Prehistoric geological processes resulted in the Pruthenian and Livonian coasts being rich with Amber, which was at times valued even more than Gold. By expanding our collection of coastal Amber deposits, we can turn Livonia into an economic powerhouse through trade down the Amber Road."
 LVA_idea_3: "Principalities of Latgalia"
 LVA_idea_3_desc: "Among the southern Livonian tribes, the Latgalians were the most advanced, holding extensive connections with the Orthodox Rus of Polotsk. Organized Christian principalities like Koknese and Jersika emerged on Latgalian land, who could deftly negotiate with European crusaders to avoid the devastation of their territories and attain mutually beneficial deals. The Latgalians would go on to form the basis of Latvia itself as they assimilated their neighboring tribes."
 LVA_idea_4: "Vikings of Curonia"
 LVA_idea_4_desc: "The Curonians were a seafaring tribe, and were considered the most restless and wealthy of the tribes, amassing great riches through naval warfare and piracy. Many considered them Baltic Vikings, as their bravery on the sea was matched by their fierceness on land."
 LVA_idea_5: "Farmlands of Semigallia"
 LVA_idea_5_desc: "Between Latgalia and Curonia lay the twin lands of the Semigallians and Selonians, known for their verdant farms and productive farmers. Wanting to continue their way of life, they were extremely resistant to the incursions of the heathen Crusaders, leading resistance under such dukes as Viestards and Nameisis."
 LVA_idea_6: "Terra Mariana"
 LVA_idea_6_desc: "After the incursions of the German crusaders, Livonia was organized into the Terra Mariana, a confederation of Crusaders, Bishoprics, and vassal tribes. Thus, even after subjugation, the Livonians remained active in the governance of the region."
 LVA_idea_7: "Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland"
 LVA_idea_7_desc: "The Enlightenment held significant sway in later Latvia, inspiring a Latvian nationalist movement. The Baltic German author Garlieb Merkel embodied the national sentiment in his book 'Die Letten Vorzüglich in Liefland am Ende des Philosophischen Jahrhunderts: Ein Beytrag zur Völker und Menschenkunde', which explained the oppression of the Latvian serfs under foreign rule. Latvians would not tolerate the same conditions under Russian rule."

 #Passau
 PSS_ideas: "Passauer Ideas"
 PSS_ideas_start: "Passauer Traditions"
 PSS_ideas_bonus: "Passauer Ambition"
 PSS_idea_1: "Sieben Künische Dörfen"
 PSS_idea_1_desc: "The villages of Wollaberg, Heindlschlag, Hintereben, Jandelsbrunn, Rosenberg, Aßberg and Grund, together with the area of Wilderranna, formed a large enclave and important foothold in the Austrian lands. The Bishops of Passau frequently founded new villages, expanding their territory and influence. Much later, when most of the Passauer land was lost due to the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the bishops only held some villages they once founded in Bohemia."
 PSS_idea_2: "Not Suitable for Large Armies"
 PSS_idea_2_desc: "Invading armies had difficulties camping in Passau, as the small territory was not rich in food resources, so the resources could easily get exhausted. And if the troops were badly provisioned, they would get hungry even before fall."
 PSS_idea_3: "Confluence of the Inn and the Danube"
 PSS_idea_3_desc: "Passau was located at the confluence of the Inn and the Danube, and because of that it was an important trade city, as it linked the German and Austrian trade. But also the Ilz river is very close, providing a link to the Bohemian lands."
 PSS_idea_4: "Salzfertiger"
 PSS_idea_4_desc: "When laws regulating the salt trade were drawn by Bishop Otto, he ruled that salt which was transported on the Inn had to be stored and offered for sale in Passau for at least three days and it went through several processing stations there which were in the hands of businessmen called Salzfertiger who ran the large warehouses for the salt storage. These merchants established a powerful monopoly against their competition from Bohemia and Austria. After the three days and the customs clearance, the salt could continue its way toward the north and east. Some salt which arrived from the Inn was transported from Passau on the water route upstream to Regensburg and downstream to Vienna."
 PSS_idea_5: "Wall-Pillar Churches"
 PSS_idea_5_desc: "These type of churches already existed, but were rarely used and often only for small churches or as parts of larger buildings. The crucial breakthrough in the creation of the wall-pillar church took place mainly in Passau, as they wanted to erect a lot more churches to impress their rival Salzburg. Wall-pillar churches allowed relatively large, wide areas to be built cheaply and quickly from bricks or rumble."
 PSS_idea_6: "Frequent Visitations of Discipline"
 PSS_idea_6_desc: "More than in other bishoprics, Passau carried many visitations of discipline, life, and morals."
 PSS_idea_7: "Reduction of the Old Diocese of Passau"
 PSS_idea_7_desc: "The Diocese of Passau is much older than the neighboring dioceses, as Passau can be considered as the successor of the ancient Roman diocese of Lorch. It was also one of the earliest states to gain princely powers.\n\nWe are, or to be more correct, were the largest diocese of the Holy Roman Empire, stretching even into Hungary, but the Pope, Austria, Bavaria and all the other neighbors don't seem to care about us, and just took away much of our influence to create more dioceses like Vienna. We should solve this militarily."

 SLZ_idea_1_desc: "The Hallein Salt Mine, also known as Salzbergwerk Dürrnberg, is an underground salt mine located in the Dürrnberg plateau. The mine has been worked for over 7,000 years since the time of the Celtic tribes and earlier. It helped ensure nearby Salzburg would become a powerful trading community; even its name comes from this mined resource."
 SLZ_idea_2: "Wars Against the Magyars"
 SLZ_idea_2_desc: "Salzburg fought difficult wars against the Magyars, who were troublesome to stop. Eventually these invaders were pushed back. We have learned many tactics from these wars, and will perform even better in the future."
 SLZ_idea_3: "Missions Give Territory"
 SLZ_idea_3_desc: "We should invest more in missionary missions, as we can possibly gain more territory that way, like during the missionary missions in the region between the Raba, Danube and Drava rivers. At the end of these missions, a dispute arose between us and Aquileia about the borders, and the Emperor fixed the issue in our advantage!"
 SLZ_idea_4: "Primas Germaniae"
 SLZ_idea_4_desc: "The Primas Germaniae is a title of honor for the most important Roman Catholic bishop in the German lands. Mainz was the first to have this title. Many others also claimed the title; like we, however, they all lost the Primate dignity, leaving us alone to bear this title!"
 SLZ_idea_5: "Convert or Leave"
 SLZ_idea_5_desc: "Protestant tendencies revealed themselves vigorously in the Bishopric, supported and promoted by the Protestant members of the imperial estates. In imitation of the Corpus Evangelicorum, the Lutherans of the Salzburg territory formed a league, binding themselves by oath and an outward rite of mutual sprinkling of salt. The Archbishop did all he could; he invited the Jesuits as missionaries, and engaged the help of the Emperor. Later he enforced the Decree of the Religious Peace of Augsburg: recantation or emigration. In ten years about 30,000 people left the territory and settled in East Prussia, or in Württemberg or Hanoverian territory; a few emigrated to Georgia in North America."
 SLZ_idea_6: "Patrons of World-Famous Musicians"
 SLZ_idea_6_desc: "The Bishops of Salzburg were famed for their patronage of many classical writers. The most famous musicians they ever supported were Mozart and Haydn."
 SLZ_idea_7: "Second-Hand Trade"
 SLZ_idea_7_desc: "The Salzburger government did not attach importance to the complaints of several traders about the reselling of used items causing unfair competition. These lax laws, together with its already large commercial importance, made Salzburg an important center of second-hand trade. It remained unregulated for almost the whole existence of the Salzburger State."

 MAG_idea_1_desc: "In 1188, archbishop Wichmann granted the city of Magdeburg city privileges, and has since then been adopted by surrounding German cities, but also spread as far as Bohemia and is still spreading further eastwards. As experts we are often called to decide controversial questions regarding the Magdeburg Rights. These rights contain various trade and merchant rights, marital laws, the abolition of kin liability and the installation of a tribunal."
 MAG_idea_2: "Bread House of the Hansa"
 MAG_idea_2_desc: "Beginning from the 13th century, Magdeburg was part of the Hansa and a pivotal center of trade at the Elbe. Also because of the staple right for corn, Magdeburg monopolized the corn trade making it the 'Bread House of the Hansa'."
 MAG_idea_3: "Unseres Herrgotts Kanzlei"
 MAG_idea_3_desc: "After the adoption of a more evangelical approach to Christianity, we have fought with verve to protect these new teachings have refused to make any concessions even under military pressure. Impressed by our religious zeal, various disciples of this new approach have honored us with the title Ünseres Herrgotts Kanzlei - our lord's chancellery."
 MAG_idea_4: "Forerunning Primas Germaniae"
 MAG_idea_4_desc: "The archbishops of Magdeburg held the title of a Primas Germaniae since a papal bull from 986. Although, there are others holding this title, too, we are the only ones to have adopted the new religious teachings. Therefore, we should use our title to become the forefront of this movement and impose our supremacy!"
 MAG_idea_5: "Risen from Ruins"
 MAG_idea_5_desc: "Our land and city was completely devastated during the so-called Magdeburg Wedding by our intolerant opponents. This coined the phrase Magdeburgization for such a terror. But if we now gave up and dissuaded from the right path, they would ultimately win. Therefore, we will rebuild our city and land to even excel our former glory!"
 MAG_idea_6: "Magdeburg Hemispheres"
 MAG_idea_6_desc: "Since we have dissolved Magdeburg's Abbey of St. Augustine and made the latter's library publicly accessible for our citizens, the pursuit of knowledge has become a goal of a lot of burghers. One example is Otto von Guericke who made an impressive experiment showing how air pressure works and giving another proof for the existence of vacua. To do so, he connected two airtight half spheres and evacuated the hollow space in between with a pump. Thereafter, eight horses on each side weren't able to pull apart the sphere; only after air flowed in again were the horses able to do so."
 MAG_idea_7: "Strongest Northern Fortress"
 MAG_idea_7_desc: "We have to learn the lessons from the past, and take care to prevent getting ravaged by foreign powers again. Thus, we will build the strongest fortress of northern Germany and build drill grounds, so our garrisons will always be prepared for sieges."

 OLD_idea_2: "Dike Building"
 OLD_idea_2_desc: "We control only a small amount of land which at the coast gets flooded. Therefore we have to build dikes at crucial positions to make more land arable and to connect some of our more remote lands with our capital."
 OLD_idea_3: "Oldenburg Horse"
 OLD_idea_3_desc: "At first only an occupation of our rulers, the breeding of horses of the Oldenburg breed has developed to a lucrative source of income. Since the Oldenburg horse is strong, well tempered and brave, so that it is heavily sought earning us the joking title of an 'Equerry of the Holy Roman Empire'."
 OLD_idea_4: "Michaelmas Market"
 OLD_idea_4_desc: "We have decreed that a market, the Michaelmas Market, shall be now held every year at the end of the harvest season. Five days starting from the Saturday before Michaelmas Day, the 27th of September, domestic and foreign merchants will be able to buy various goods for sale strengthening our trade."
 OLD_idea_5: "Abbey Blankenburg Foundation"
 OLD_idea_5_desc: "After we have chosen to follow Luther's teaching, we have dissolved our country's abbeys of which some stand empty. As the poor and orphans had no longer a place to dwell, we have decided to learn from our mistakes and institute a foundation at the former Abbey Blankenburg."
 OLD_idea_6: "Elsether Weserzoll"
 OLD_idea_6_desc: "Although we were granted the privilege to tariff ships passing the toll station at Elseth which is the last toll station before the mouth of the river Weser, the emperor had to help us to bend Bremen's will to accept this toll. Since we have to operate many dikes and a lighthouse at the isle of Wangerooge, this toll seems justified to us. Now, the additional ducats will fill our treasury!"
 OLD_idea_7: "Elevation to a Duchy"
 OLD_idea_7_desc: "Ever since time immemorial, Oldenburg was only a county. But, now that we have expanded and claimed other land titles, the time is at hand to proclaim the Duchy of Oldenburg. Now, we will no longer be looked down on by dukes owning less land than we do!"

If at every coronation all of our nobles pledge their allegiance to our ruler, their support of our reign will be guaranteed, legitimizing our sovereignty."
 STY_idea_2: "Military Frontier"
 STY_idea_2_desc: "The defense of our frontiers is a serious issue, not so much how to do it but how to pay for it. The solution we have hit upon it to make generous land grants on the frontier to build up a professional military class. Not only will this ensure our frontier is adequately defended at a reasonable price but these men will be available for other tasks."
 STY_idea_3: "Rezeß von Wien"
 STY_idea_3_desc: "For a long time, there were exclaves of clerical territories amidst Styria. We have been able to negotiate an agreement with the corresponding rulers. From now on we will be the worldly sovereign being able to tax and raise troops in these regions. However, these territories will still belong to their lordships, and they will still be responsible for all judicial matters."

We will found the Inner Austrian Hofkriegsrat in which we will convene and counsel with our territorial estates close to the border. This will help to decide with as much information as possible, so that our defensive actions will be more organized."
 STY_idea_5: "Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft"
 STY_idea_5_desc: "For a long time our iron industry was decentralized and was split into many different facilities often taking care of only one production step. Whereas, the foundation of the Innerberger Hauptgewerkschaft will lead to the whole production and trade being managed centrally benefiting our iron production."
 STY_idea_6: "Landeszeughaus"
 STY_idea_6_desc: "From now on, our weaponry and military equipment will be stored in the newly built Landeszeughaus of Graz. With its capacity to store equipment for about 16,000 soldiers, it is the biggest armory of the world and will greatly reduce our storage costs."

 NIC_idea_5: "The New Town"
 NIC_idea_5_desc: "After 1713, when the Treaty of Utrecht was signed, Nice was firmly re-attached to Savoy and a period of peace followed. In this time, work began on the construction of a 'New Town', fit with all the trappings of a sleek, contemporary Enlightenment city."
 NIC_idea_6: "Garibaldi's Birthplace"
 NIC_idea_6_desc: "Giuseppe Garibaldi is one of the most important figures in the history of Italy, standing alongside the likes of Julius Caesar and Theoderic. His nationalist campaign of 'Risorgimento' led to the unification of the peninsula under one flag for the first time in centuries, and he himself was a native of Nice. Giuseppe was always fond of his birthplace and opposed its annexation by France."
 NIC_idea_7: "Between Two Worlds"
 NIC_idea_7_desc: "For a long time, Nice has sat at the crossroads of France and Italy, poised just beneath the end of the Alps between the Comte de Provence and the Ducato di Savoia.

 PIO_idea_1: "Guarnito d'Appiano"
 PIO_idea_1_desc: "The earliest ancestor of Piombino's royal family was Guarnito d'Appiano, who appeared as a notary in the Republic of Pisa in the early thirteenth century. The family he started was endlessly ambitious, first rising up the ranks of notary guilds, then attaining governmental positions within Pisa, and finally becoming leaders of the Republic."
 PIO_idea_2: "Etruscan Origins"
 PIO_idea_2_desc: "Many cities across the Western world boast of their Roman origins. Piombino, on the other hand, has a pedigree reaching back before the Romans themselves to the Etruscan civilization. The area was known to the Etruscans as Populonia, and was one of their most important ports."
 PIO_idea_3: "Elba"
 PIO_idea_3_desc: "The jewel in the crown of Piombino is the island of Elba, which has been coveted since the Hellenistic era. The island's capital earned the name Portoferraio due to its rich metal deposits, and the island's defenses were so respected that it was chosen as the prison-house for Napoléon upon his first defeat."
 PIO_idea_4: "Fortify Against Piracy"
 PIO_idea_4_desc: "Though one does not think of the Barbary Coast as falling near Tuscany, Barbary pirates nevertheless devastated Elba, Piombino, and nearby surroundings with their raids. We must fortify against these raging infidels with coastal fortresses - construct the Torre Mozza and redouble the strength of our city walls!"
 PIO_idea_5: "Thalassocratic State"
 PIO_idea_5_desc: "Holding territories only on the immediate coast and on islands, Piombino is the ideal thalassocratic state. Our sailors are well-trained, and our navies have an edge over the inland city-states occupying the rest of Tuscany."
 PIO_idea_6: "Lucca e Piombino"
 PIO_idea_6_desc: "At the time of Napoléon, our state was merged with Lucca to form a new principality. The significance of this action cannot be understated - thousands of sovereign polities met their end with Napoléon and his mediatization, but Piombino was significant enough to continue on in joint rule, under Napoléon's sister Elisa no less."
 PIO_idea_7: "Piombinesi Industry"
 PIO_idea_7_desc: "The hinterland around Piombino is ripe for industrial exploitation. Let factory farms rise in the fertile fields, and where they cannot, let great coal processing factories spew out smoke until all the fields are in shadow, and the farmers can farm in the shade!"

 TIR_idea_7_desc: "Winter is an enemy for every nation that is in a war. But winters in the Alps are ten times more severe. It creates too many troubles for the nations who dare to cross the Alps. Because of this, we must use the Alps to create attrition for our enemies."

The title was continued by all branches during the division of the parent house and passed on like a hereditary imperial fief. The importance of the Vögte was of such great value that the local land today bears the name 'Vogtland'."
 VOG_idea_2: "Heinrichinger"
 VOG_idea_2_desc: "The members of the House of Reuß were Vögte of Weida, Gera and Plauen and were appointed by Emperor Henry VI - in his honor all male descendants received the name Henry.

 VOG_idea_3: "Vogtland War"
 VOG_idea_3_desc: "While the heads of the Vogt families of Weida, Gera and Plauen had still acted uniformly in external terms until the middle of the 13th century, they fell victim to the expansive efforts of their neighbours, the Margraves of Meissen and the Kings of Bohemia: the Vögte of Weida and Gera joined the Wettins, while the Vögte of Plauen went under Bohemian feudal rule in 1327. In the Vogtland War of 1354-57, the Vögte of Weida, Gera and Plauen lost most of their property to Emperor Charles IV and the Wettins. With strong allies, we must reclaim what is rightfully ours."
 VOG_idea_4: "Instrument Makers"

 VOG_idea_5: "Plauener Spitze"
 VOG_idea_5_desc: "The origin of Plauen Lace was the refinement of smooth cotton fabrics using satin stitch embroidery, which began at the beginning of the 19th century. Later, tulle was also stitched. Only the introduction of the shuttle embroidery machine in 1883 accelerated the mechanical production of tulle and etched lace. Today, this brand represents less a certain type of lace but functions primarily as a quality seal and umbrella brand for all regionally produced embroidery products."
 VOG_idea_6: "Bäderfünfeck"
 VOG_idea_6_desc: "The Vogtland is regarded as one of the most volcanically active zones in Central Europe. Signs of this are swarm earthquakes, hot springs and gas leaks. The healing springs have allowed the health resorts of Bad Elster and Bad Brambach to flourish with the strongest radium mineral spring in the world. With Marienbad, Franzensbad and Karlsbad on the Czech-Bohemian side, the two Saxon national spas form the so-called Bäderfünfeck."
 VOG_idea_7: "Saxon and Thuringian Industrial Centers"

 PAD_idea_5: "Kümpe"
 PAD_idea_5_desc: "It was the fire catastrophe of 1506, which destroyed 300 houses, that caused the Paderborner Council to take preventive fire protection measures and to fundamentally improve the fire-fighting water supply, even away from springs and river arms. The force of the flowing water of the Pader river was transferred via a water wheel to a piston pump, which transported water artificially uphill via a wooden pipe system to the higher parts of the town. There were large stone basins, so-called Kümpe, from which the people of Paderborn could draw water for extinguishing, but of course also for their everyday needs."
 PAD_idea_6: "Cautio Criminalis"
 PAD_idea_6_desc: "With this Latin work, the Catholic poet and Jesuit Friedrich Spee opposed the practice of the witch trials and made a decisive contribution to the end of witchcraft in Germany by means of perceptive argumentation and clever rhetoric. He did not question that people might have magical abilities with the help of the devil. But in order to recognize such witches and magicians in individual cases, the procedures used in witch trials are not suitable. With the physical torments of torture, everyone could be forced to make a confession."

 WRM_idea_6: "Protestants Undesirable"
 WRM_idea_6_desc: "With the beginning of the Reformation, the entire environs of Warmia gradually converted to the Protestant faith.

 LGN_idea_4: "Development Before War"
 LGN_idea_4_desc: "Legnica always preferred to be rich rather than just powerful. An example of its flourishing economy is that there were many houses outside of the city walls. However, when war came, the people that lived outside the city walls were often hired as mercenaries by the duke."
 LGN_idea_5: "The Knight Academy"
 LGN_idea_5_desc: "In 1708 a state-run Knight School was opened in Legnica. It was open to members of all religions, however restricted only for the nobility of course.

 LGN_idea_6: "Urbanization"
 LGN_idea_6_desc: "With the inclusion of Legnica into Prussia, it became the capital of the Regierungsbezirk Niederschlesien.

 LGN_idea_7: "The Strain of Survival"
 LGN_idea_7_desc: "We cannot let our neighbours bully our duchy. We need to expand our diplomacy in order to secure relations with some powerful states. In 1806 Legnica wanted to surrender to Russian forces, but nobody was brave enough to inform them about their surrender."

 LEB_idea_2: "Crusader Baronies"
 LEB_idea_2_desc: "During the Crusades, the entire Lebanese coast was conquered by the Crusading armies and re-organized into baronies like the Lordship of Beirut and the Lordship of Sidon. Beirut ended up being one of the most long-lived of all Crusader states and a center of royal Jerusalemite power."
 LEB_idea_3: "Ma'anids"
 LEB_idea_3_desc: "The first reigning dynasty of the Mount Lebanon Emirate under Ottoman suzerainty was the Banu Ma'an family, which originated in southern Arabia.

 GAZ_idea_6: "Fickle Diplomacy"

 GAZ_idea_7: "Resist Gulistan"
 GAZ_idea_7_desc: "Russia began to pry into Shamkhal affairs with the construction of Sunzha fortress in 1566.

We gained their trust, and when Timurba?, a governor of Anatolia, was afraid of Mongols kidnapping and killing him he appointed us as his regent. But we refused to be just a regent and took over Eastern Anatolia. So by claiming that we are technically the governor of Anatolia, the fabrication of claims will be much easier for us."

 ERE_idea_5: "Power of Governors"
 ERE_idea_5_desc: "Our nation started with quite a big land, and governing this may cause some trouble to us. Even though we don't want to admit it, we must govern our nation by giving governors more power and let them govern our cities."

 ERE_idea_7: "Mountains of the East"

 TBR_idea_5_desc: "The Arg of Tabriz was built in the 14th century during the Ilkhanate era and is a landmark of the city thanks to its exceptional construction. The point of pride for the building is that its vaulted ayvan is larger than the famous historic vault of Chosroes or the Taq Kisra at Ctesiphon.

However, after many years our power declined and we have become a weak state. But now it's time to claim what is rightfully ours and we won't be afraid of battling our foes by doing so. To arms!"
 GOL_idea_2: "Our Ancestors' Religions"
 GOL_idea_2_desc: "Even if we believe in Islam now, our ancestors had different beliefs such as Tengrism or Buddhism. We can't throw our culture away, else can we really call ourselves a state? We must tolerate our former religions if we really want to call ourselves a nation with history."
 GOL_idea_3: "Kipchak Cavalry"

 GOL_idea_4: "Great Stand of Ugra"
 GOL_idea_4_desc: "Russian lands were always a sweet target for us, and we were able to control these lands for a while, even though we don't want to accept that we are not in a golden age. So in 1480, we chose to leave the Russians alone instead of fighting. The Russians knew that if we tried to defeat them, we could. So our mercy to them will benefit us on the diplomatic stage."

 GOL_idea_6_desc: "A lot of nations around us think that we are some barbaric state which just raids nations. But it is not true. We adopted a sedentary culture and founded our own cities, such as Sarai. We know how to found and improve a city and we couldn't need that knowledge more right now as we don't have much land."
 GOL_idea_7: "Tributary System"
 GOL_idea_7_desc: "We don't always want to conquer, instead we may need money for our nation. So our ancestors found a great way to gain some money for our nation: they made other nations pay for us.

 OSS_idea_1_desc: "Alans are unique among the Caucasian tribes for their Iranic origins, descending from the ancient Sarmatians who once occupied the whole Pontic-Caspian steppe. Eventually the Alan ethnonym would shift again to Ossetian, but never lose sight of its prestigious origins."
 OSS_idea_2: "Darial Pass"
 OSS_idea_2_desc: "The gateway across the Caucasus mountains is Darial Gorge, which lies in the Ossetian heartland, leading to its nickname 'Gate of the Alans'. By controlling this pass we control trade through the whole region."
 OSS_idea_3: "Religious Flexibility"
 OSS_idea_3_desc: "The native religion of the Alans is a form of Scythian Paganism called Ætsæg Din. However, the Alans frequently switched their nominal religious profession for diplomatic reasons, at times converting to the Judaism of the Khazars and at times the Orthodox Christianity of the Georgians and Byzantines."
 OSS_idea_4: "David Soslan"

 DRB_idea_1: "Gateway to Persia"
 DRB_idea_1_desc: "The name 'Derbent' comes from the Persian word for 'gateway', 'darband'. The city stood as a reliable passage over the Caucasus range and was guarded in the Achaemenid and Sassanid eras as a Satrapy within the Persian sphere of influence."
 DRB_idea_2: "Walls of Khosrau"
 DRB_idea_2_desc: "The Old City of Derbent is surrounded by 66-foot high walls from the reign of the Sassanid Shah Khosrau I, son of Kavadh. The later Arab rulers of Derbent believed that the walls were one of the Seven Wonders of the World."
 DRB_idea_3: "Harun al-Rashid"
 DRB_idea_3_desc: "No Caliph is more widely respected by Muslims and non-Muslims alike than Harun al-Rashid, who oversaw the flourishing of the Islamic Golden Age. Harun lived in Derbent for part of his life and solidified its position as a center of Islamic culture and science."
 DRB_idea_4: "House of Derbent"
 DRB_idea_4_desc: "The Anushiruwanid or 'Shirvanshah' dynasty formed a cadet branch to rule Derbent that eventually inherited the main Shirvani state itself. The dynasty claimed descent from the Sassanids themselves, and was the longest continually-ruling dynasty in Muslim history."
 DRB_idea_5: "Mountain Jews"
 DRB_idea_5_desc: "From the time of the Khazars Derbent had a consistent Jewish population, being significant enough to find mention in the writings of Benjamin of Tudela. These Jews were connected to the so-called 'mountain Jews' that lived in the Caucasian foothills."
 DRB_idea_6: "History of Resistance"

 MEI_idea_1: "Cradle of Saxony"
 MEI_idea_1_desc: "Meissen has often been nicknamed the "Cradle of Saxony", owing to its central position in the region and enduring importance through the centuries. Founded in 929 by Henry the Fowler, king of East Francia, on an ancient Slavic settlement, it quickly became one of the most important cities in Saxony."
 MEI_idea_2: "Albrechtsburg"
 MEI_idea_2_desc: "Meissen's roots can be traced back to the series of fortifications now known as Albrechtsburg, established as Meissen Castle in 929 between the Elbe and Triebisch rivers to protect East Frankish gains against the Slavic Glomacze tribe. In 1471 a castle was built on the site, but it was used as a residence rather than a fortress which made it the first in Germany to be used for that purpose."
 MEI_idea_3: "Wettin Legacy"
 MEI_idea_3_desc: "In 1089, the count of Eilenburg, Henry the Elder was granted the Margraviate of Meissen after the deposition of its previous Margrave who had opposed the Holy Roman Emperor. Henry was of the Wettin dynasty, whose members would rule Meissen and then the duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg after it was inherited in 1423. This has given Meissen a respectable legacy."
 MEI_idea_4: "Elbtal Wine Region"
 MEI_idea_4_desc: "Evidence of viticulture in the region around Meissen dates to 1161, and the city is located in the center of a small region ideal for the growth of vineyards despite its northern location. With our annual wine festivals we can cultivate new interest in a commodity that few places in Germany can offer."
 MEI_idea_5: "Edge of the Mongol Invasions"
 MEI_idea_5_desc: "In April 1241, a Mongol reconnaissance party led by Orda Khan annihilated a Polish force at Legnica. In the wake of this catastrophic defeat, there was nothing to stop the Mongol advance further into Germany. Meissen was at the very edge of the Mongols' swords, being the farthest west they had launched a raid. Most of the town was burned to the ground, but we have been able to use this experience and learn from it. Now, we will not yield an inch when there is an invader at our doorstep."
 MEI_idea_6: "Burgraviate of Meissen"
 MEI_idea_6_desc: "The burgrave was a military governor of a castle and its surrounding environs. Meissen was granted one such burgraviate in the 12th century during the Ostsiedlung, being only one of a few cities in Germany to receive such a distinction. The Meinheringer family would rise to prominence in this position as the status of burgrave became more prestigious over time."
 MEI_idea_7: "Meissener Porcelain"
 MEI_idea_7_desc: "Meissen is famous worldwide for its porcelain; it was the first high-quality porcelain to be produced anywhere outside of East Asia, pioneered by the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger in 1710. For a time, the city held a monopoly on its production as very few artisans knew the methods required to make porcelain. Meissen took its porcelain manufacturing so seriously that a trademarked 'crossed swords' logo was used to identify their original products."

 TLC_idea_2: "Enduring Sultanate"
 TLC_idea_2_desc: "The Marinids, ruling Morocco to the west, have always harbored ambitions of subjugating the people of Tlemcen. But when the Moroccan sultan Abu Inan Faris tried to occupy our lands in the 14th century, the local Berbers revolted and successfully drove them out. This has shown the unyielding resolve of our people - even as our soil is devastated, we will not give it up."
 TLC_idea_3: "Unite the Berbers"
 TLC_idea_3_desc: "The Berber tribesmen within our state have often posed the biggest threat to our continued existence, rather than the neighboring sultanates. This must be rectified by maintaining a national identity and a sense of unity among the warring Berbers so that they may fight under our banner instead of their own."
 TLC_idea_4: "Commerce of the Atlas Mountains"
 TLC_idea_4_desc: "Tlemcen since its inception has become the principal trading hub in the central Maghreb, in no small part due to its strategic position near the Atlas Mountains. Its location on the trade route linking Sijilmassa and Oran makes it ideal for the trans-Saharan caravans to pass through; meanwhile, the route to Fez is far less favorable due to the mountainous terrain. Even Barbary corsairs are growing the economy by acquiring goods from the Mediterranean and selling them at Tlemcen. Furthermore, Europeans have even recognized the importance of Tlemcen, with a 'funduk' (trading center) being established there."
 TLC_idea_5: "Wars with Ifriqiya"
 TLC_idea_5_desc: "Throughout the 15th century, the Zayyanids attempted to expand east into the Hafsid sultanate of Ifriqiya numerous times, but ultimately were unsuccessful. However, these wars have given us much-needed experience - let us apply it to our successful conquests."
 TLC_idea_6: "Madrasas of Tlemcen"
 TLC_idea_6_desc: "Tlemcen has an abundance of madrasas and religious institutions which have made it the foremost intellectual center of the central Maghreb. We can leverage the power and wealth of the mosques to propagate the Muslim faith further afield, especially to the Berbers who have resisted conversion in the past."
 TLC_idea_7: "Curtail Arab Nomads"
 TLC_idea_7_desc: "In the past we have relied heavily on Arab nomads to fight our wars, and while they can be effective, they can also be difficult to rein in. We must eschew the old ways of warfare and grow a modern standing army with troops loyal to the Sultan if we are to put up a fight against outside threats."

Each of them grew wealthy from trade and became considerably autonomous from their Byzantine rulers. The Pentapolis left behind a legacy of maritime might, the promotion of trade, and independence, which Rimini shall proudly uphold."
 RIM_idea_2: "The Ascent of the Malatesta"
 RIM_idea_2_desc: "Rimini had some importance during the Middle Ages as a commercial hub on the Adriatic, yet at the same time it was subjected to the Archbishops of Ravenna, limiting its freedom and development. This changed in the 12th century when Rimini became independent. In the ensuing factional conflicts throughout Italy, Rimini aligned with the pro-Papal Guelphs. The aftermath of the conflict led to the rise of the Malatesta family, who shaped Rimini politically for centuries."
 RIM_idea_3: "Carlo I and Condottieri"
 RIM_idea_3_desc: "Carlo I Malatesta, Lord of Rimini, was not only known for his political and diplomatic skills, but also his status as a captain of fortune. As a result, condottieri had a profound impact on Riminesi history. The following rulers of Rimini, most notably Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, often rented out condottieri to various Italian states. Riminesi condottieri were very sought after and fought for various Italian powerhouses such as Venice, Milan, and the Papal States, bringing income and prestige to the city."
 RIM_idea_4: "Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta"
 RIM_idea_4_desc: "The Lord of Rimini in the early 15th century, Sigismondo Pandolfo, not only participated in various wars but was also a patron of the arts, hiring the most prestigious artists in Italy. Malatesta’s promotion of the arts was central to his need of funds, forcing him into conflict with other Italian states to cover those expenses. He was ambitious and in his lifetime warred against Urbino, Milan, Naples and the Pope, enlarging his possessions in Romagna and Marche. Fighting for the Venetians, he even saw action against the Ottomans in Morea."
 RIM_idea_5: "Rinascimento Riminesi"
 RIM_idea_5_desc: "The Malatesta family patronized many cultural projects during the early Renaissance. As part of the Rinascimento Riminesi, the Malatesta Library was built in Cesena, and was the first civic library in all of Italy, open to all citizens and containing works of philosophy, theology, and science. Artists such as Leon Battista Alberti and Piero della Francesca worked on projects in Rimini, and later, Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta rebuilt the Church of San Francesco under the direction of Agostino di Duccio."
 RIM_idea_6: "Plaza del Comune"
 RIM_idea_6_desc: "Starting in the 12th century, the Plaza del Comune became the center of civil power in Rimini. The plaza housed the Palazzo dell’Arrengo, Palazzo del Podestà, the market, as well as medieval traditions such as equestrian tournaments. While small in size, through its importance for the fostering of Riminesi culture, the plaza is integral to Rimini as a whole."
 RIM_idea_7: "Solidify Papal Relations"
 RIM_idea_7_desc: "Rimini was thrust into a predicament mainly as a result of the Italian Wars. When the Duke of Urbino, Cesare Borgia, seized the lands of the lords of Romagna, the absorption of Rimini to either the Papal States or France seemed inevitable. Even though we have a rich military background, diplomacy may be a better and safer option. If Rimini can balance proving its worth as an independent commune to its potentially hostile neighbors, it will be possible to escape any precarious situation."

It became a Benedictine monastery in the 7th century. The citizens of Metz must be proud of their city's long Christian history and traditions."
 MTZ_idea_2: "Capital of Lotharingia"
 MTZ_idea_2_desc: "For two centuries Metz was the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia, whose power and authority spanned over vast swathes of territory from the North Sea to the Alps. The position and distinction made Metz at one point one of the most important and powerful cities in Central Europe. It shall be the goal of the city and its leaders to restore the past power and glory of the city."
 MTZ_idea_3: "Saint-Stephen Cathedral"
 MTZ_idea_3_desc: "Cathédrale Saint Étienne de Metz, constructed between the 13th and 16th centuries, is nicknamed la Lanterne du Bon Dieu as a result of having among the highest naves and the largest stained glass windows in all of Europe. Such a feat and achievement showcases the immense prestige and power of the city of Metz."
 MTZ_idea_4: "Crossroads of Cultures"
 MTZ_idea_4_desc: "As a result of its location on the Moselle and near the border between the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire, Metz was at the crossroads of many different cultures and languages including both Romance and Germanic. The people of Metz should be inclusive of all its citizens, even those of other cultures, for the benefit of the city."
 MTZ_idea_5: "The Maid and the Unviolated"
 MTZ_idea_5_desc: "Although its location between France and Germany gave Metz special importance within the Holy Roman Empire, it also became a key weakness of the city as it attracted many foreign invasions seeking to control the important and strategic garrison city. Armies of England, France, Lorraine, Provence, Trier and Luxemburg all tried but to no avail to invade Metz. We shall stand firm and preserve our independence and autonomy."
 MTZ_idea_6: "Les Trois-Évêchés"
 MTZ_idea_6_desc: "Under the Treaty of Chambord in 1522, Metz, along with Toul and Verdun, passed to the control of the French monarchy. The cities, all former Prince-Bishoprics and Free Imperial Cities, became governed together in an entity known as the Three Bishoprics, or les Trois-Évêchés. Imperial forces tried to recover its former possessions in the Siege of Metz in 1552 and 1553 but failed. Metz became the center and capital of the Three Bishoprics and prospered in the following centuries under French rule."
 MTZ_idea_7: "The Heart of Lorraine"
 MTZ_idea_7_desc: "For centuries Metz was and has been the largest city in Lorraine, and its chief economic center, exporting steel, as well as its chief cultural center. It was considerably more significant, wealthy, and important than even Nancy, the capital of the Duchy of Lorraine."

When his retreat from Milan to Arles was blocked, he was forced to hole up in Asti, where after months of siege the great general Stilicho arrived and crushed the Barbarians at the Battle of Pollentia. Asti's heroic resistance to the Barbarians lives on in legend."
 ATI_idea_2: "Episcopal Privileges"
 ATI_idea_2_desc: "Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor in the early eleventh century, granted extensive privileges to the Bishopric of Asti, making it one of the most powerful sees in northern Italy."
 ATI_idea_3: "The Oldest Republic"
 ATI_idea_3_desc: "While various cities claim to have been the oldest republic in Europe, the formation of a commune in Asti in 1095 is believed by locals to earn us this accolade."
 ATI_idea_4: "French Connections"
 ATI_idea_4_desc: "The County of Asti was granted in the late Middle Ages first to the Angevins and then to the house of Valois-Orléans. These powerful French lords used Asti as a base of operations in Italy and expanded its political power in the region greatly."
 ATI_idea_5: "Torre Rossa"
 ATI_idea_5_desc: "Asti is home to many ancient and medieval towers. Perhaps the most famous is the Torre Rossa, built during the reign of the first Roman Emperor, Augustus Caesar, originally as a red-brick Romanesque construction."

 MSS_idea_1: "Marca Obertenga"
 MSS_idea_1_desc: "The fortunes of the Malaspina family go back to the tenth century, when a certain Oberto was one of the local lords invested by Otto the Great with new titles carved out of the Kingdom of Italy. Otto divided southern Lombardy into a series of marches, the Marca Arduinica under Arduino, the Marca Aleramica under Aleramo, and the Marca Obertenga under Oberto. It is from this 'Obertenghi' family that the Malaspina derive."
 MSS_idea_2: "Badthorn"
 MSS_idea_2_desc: "The name 'Malaspina' literally means 'Badthorn', and originated as a nickname for the margrave Alberto. This intriguing name is reflected in the iconic Malaspina coat of arms, which depicts a thorn-covered flowering plant."
 MSS_idea_3: "Powerful Cadets"
 MSS_idea_3_desc: "The Obertenghi family did not just produce the Malaspinas. Other cadet branches include the prestigious Lombard family the Pallavicinos, the Este family of Romagna, and most importantly, the Welf family of Germany that would go on to rule the British Empire through their own cadet branch, the House of Hannover."
 MSS_idea_4: "Dante"
 MSS_idea_4_desc: "Dante Alighieri condemns a staggering amount of medieval Italian figures over the course of his famous Divine Comedy. The Malaspina are one of the few families he praises, due to his friendship with Moroello Malaspina, who hosted him in Lunigiana several times and even had him broker a peace deal in 1306. Dante's kind words are in the eighth canto of Purgatorio, where he says, 'Where throughout all Europe dwelleth a man who knows them not?'."
 MSS_idea_5: "Spino Secco and Spino Fiorito"
 MSS_idea_5_desc: "One of the most notable features of the Malaspina family was the degree to which their lands fragmented to increasingly small titles over the course of the Middle Ages. The most basic division was that between the Spino Secco branch, who largely held possessions north of Genoa, and the Spino Fiorito branch, who largely held possessions in Lunigiana."
 MSS_idea_6: "Lunigiana"
 MSS_idea_6_desc: "Tucked between the Appenines and the riviera of Liguria, the Lunigiana is a hilly and isolated region named for the ancient Roman city of Luni. Despite its small confines, numerous castles were built by the various Malaspina branches that resided there, making it difficult to cross or invade for hostile forces."
 MSS_idea_7: "Massa and Carrara"
 MSS_idea_7_desc: "The Duchy of Massa and Carrara, established in the fifteenth century, went on to become one of the few titles in all Italy that survived up to the time of Napoleon Bonaparte, when it was finally combined with Lucca to form a duchy for Napoleon's sister Elisa."

 KRL_idea_1: "Lake Ladoga"
 KRL_idea_1_desc: "The centerpiece of Karelia is Lake Ladoga, named after the fort of Staraya Ladoga on its southern coast. This fort, built in the eighth century, was the first capital of Rurik himself and became one of the most important trade centers in Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages. The whole Varangian trade route connecting Scandinavia to Constantinople and the Far East passed through Ladoga."
 KRL_idea_2: "Veps"
 KRL_idea_2_desc: "In addition to the main population of Karelians, the Veps or Vepsians are another ethnic group that once inhabited a vast area eventually settled by Ilmen Slavs. Vepsian is closely related to Karelian, and surely if we promote mutual contact and communication we can bring our two people even closer together."
 KRL_idea_3: "Novgorodian Connections"
 KRL_idea_3_desc: "In the high Middle Ages, Karelians were feared by even the Vikings for their prowess in raiding and pillaging settlements. Gradually, the Karelians began to cooperate with Novgorod and fall under its dominance. Though this lost us our autonomy and our ancient faith, it provided lucrative trading opportunities that we would have otherwise never had as mere raiders."
 KRL_idea_4: "Legacy of Nöteborg"
 KRL_idea_4_desc: "The treaty of Nöteborg in 1323 partitioned Karelia between the spheres of influence of the Novgorodian Russians and the Swedes. This has left Karelia's identity split between two states, two languages, and two religions. We must enforce our unity and promote a common Karelian identity across the continent, no matter what language is spoken by the ruling class."
 KRL_idea_5: "Two Dueling Arms"
 KRL_idea_5_desc: "As a result of Nöteborg, Karelia even has two separate coats of arms, one under Sweden and one under Russia. The Russian blazon depicts a bear, while the Swedish blazon, first presented at the death of Gustav Vasa in 1560, fittingly depicts 'a crown or above two dueling arms argent, the left gauntleted with a sword and the right mailed with a scimitar'."
 KRL_idea_6: "Kizhi Pogost"
 KRL_idea_6_desc: "Karelia is noted for its unique Russian-style wooden architecture, including multi-levelled domed churches like Kizhi Pogost on the island of Kizhi. The church's eighteenth-century wooden paneling is legendary for its intricacy, and its painted iconostasis brings onlookers to tears through its beauty."
 KRL_idea_7: "Karelianism"
 KRL_idea_7_desc: "Karelianism refers to a cultural movement in the Grand Duchy of Finland while it was attempting to define its identity in the late nineteenth century. Poets, painters, and folklorists viewed Karelian culture as the 'true and original' Finnish culture untainted by outside influence, and the Finnish national epic Kalevala was based off of Karelian legends and traditions."

When she married Yaroslav the Wise in 1019, she was given the important fort and trade hub of Staraya Ladoga as a gift, and her name became applied to the region and peoples around it."
 IGR_idea_2: "Votes and Izhorians"
 IGR_idea_2_desc: "Ingria is comprised of several distinct ethnic groups, including Votes and Izhorians. The Votes were the first Finnic tribe to settle in the area and were feared by the Russians for their fierce raiding, while the Izhorians migrated to Ingria from Karelia only in the eleventh century. Ingrians proper are further divided into Savakots and Äyrämöisets."
 IGR_idea_3: "Karelian Isthmus"
 IGR_idea_3_desc: "The Karelian Isthmus sits at the mouth of the Baltic Sea and mediates all trade between the inland lakes and rivers and the rest of Europe. We must make use of the fact that this important natural formation borders our homeland and establish trading outposts at Neva."
 IGR_idea_4: "Kylfings"
 IGR_idea_4_desc: "The Kylfings were a group of Scandinavian marauders and mercenaries who served far and wide in the armies of Europe, including those of Hungary and the Byzantine Empire. Their origin has never been determined with certainty, but a popular theory was that they were in fact Ingrian Finns."
 IGR_idea_5: "Sardo"
 IGR_idea_5_desc: "The people of Ingria practice slash-and-burn farming techniques, known in the Ingrian language as 'sardo'. Though this accounted for much of their food, there was also an extensive system of collaborative fishing and livestock rearing. In addition to standard cattle husbandry, horses and geese were also popular in ranches."
 IGR_idea_6: "Slottslän Fleet"
 IGR_idea_6_desc: "In the Swedish era, Ingria was divided into four counties or 'slottslän', each centered around a fortified town - Ivangorod, Jama, Caporie, and Nöteborg. Ingria's towns became important naval hubs for Baltic Sea trade and warfare, with the inland forests being excellent for shipbuilding."
 IGR_idea_7: "Kreevins"
 IGR_idea_7_desc: "When the Teutonic Knights invaded Ingria in 1444, they captured many slaves and brought them back to Livonia to construct castles. The slaves afterward assimilated into the local Latvian populations, forgetting they were ever Ingrians. Nevertheless, we can take advantage of the fact that we have brethren in this neighboring land."

 RVE_idea_6: "Agricultural Improvements"
 RVE_idea_6_desc: "A key disadvantage and barrier to Ravenna's growth is its geography.

Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."

Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region.

It is through this legacy that we again can rise to prominence and prestige should warfare fail us."

However, this period was not filled with constant warfare as there was indeed periods of peace, it did cause a great amount of devasation to the heartland of the Jin Dynasty. We need to ensure that a succession struggle like this does not happen again and to mediate any future succession disputes before they reach our throne."

The ensuing chaos that was partly caused by the invasion of the Five Barbarians resulted in the formation of the Eastern Jin and a subsequent loss in power for the Jin Dynasty as a whole, yet, we recovered from this and drove back the barbarians back toward the north. We must take this lesson from our past and keep it close to us and never again let those barbarians enter China again."

Zhuge Liang in particular took control of most matters and attempted to put the Shu state in a better position against the domineering Wei state via aggressive expeditions from 228 to 234. Though none of the expeditions resulted in major changes on the political or military stage, the endurance and cunning that Zhuge Liang displayed as well as dedication to the Shu state is something all of us admire and strive to emulate."

 defensive_position_desc: "The geography of the Sichuan Basin makes it ideal for defending.

South and west of the Sichuan Basin lay divided land that is tough to subjugate, but lucrative in trading opportunities. We need not always conquer places that provide us with wealth and resources, for they will soon bow to the people of Shu in time.

As authority from the court in Luoyi declined (having already been in a downward spiral since the invasion of the Quanrong prior to 771BC), power in the hands of smaller states grew immensely to the point where the they would wage wars against each other for hegemony and pay little attention to the Eastern Zhou. It is here that Chu gained its strength and passion to fight for itself, both of which we have not lost."

Though we were larger than they were in both military size and territorial size, they were much more disciplined and administratively focused; our ancestors simply could not compete against them and fell in them in about 223BC. Now that we are resurgent, we would do well to reform our military and practice proper discipline within so that any rivals to our power won't win so easily. The legalism can come later."

Sure, our arts and crafts were truly unique and our culture was flourishing, but this relaxed nature will lead to inefficient societies that lead further into decadance, something that most assuredly happened to our ancestors.

 chola_empire_influences_desc: "The ships and merchants from the Chola Empire taught the Malay people a great many things about trade routes and mercantile ways, much of which still remain with our people. By utilizing what they've taught our people from so long ago and building upon it, Kedah will be able to garner more power from simply trade routes and trade sectors alone."

 quality_army_of_kedah_desc: "The military of Kedah is something that shouldn't be overlooked. For too long we have relied on tactics and strategies from foreign states where they swear allegiance to foreign lords. Kedah must come up with its own unique tactics and strategies so that its troops will be of the highest quality compared to neighboring states, and states from far away."
 confluence_of_giants: "At the Confluence of Giants"
 confluence_of_giants_desc: "From the north, the Thai kingdoms reign supreme, one after another. From the south, kingdoms and smaller states rock the jungles and waters alike to show dominance. Kedah is at the crossroads of both regions and as a result, hears and witnesses some of these great nations do battle. Kedah and its people must watch and learn carefully as they clash, so that the military of Kedah can build up its own measures against what is currently employed in battle."

 utilize_corsairs: "Utilize Corsairs"
 utilize_corsairs_desc: "The tradition of pirating and using corsairs for shady interests is well known throughout Algiers and our navy is especially adept at it. If we invest in improvements into training and the materials and weapons used by our corsairs, maybe we can see a boost in profits? Or maybe we can see more ships come into our fold when they engage in battles on the high seas; enemy ships are always useful, whether its for scrap material or for use in our own fleet."
 import_gunpowder_weaponry: "Import Gunpowder Weaponry"
 import_gunpowder_weaponry_desc: "We are often used to the traditional methods of doing warfare in North Africa: blades, spears, bows-and-arrows, crossbows, and armor of some kind. This, however, is slowly becoming outdated as more and more we are seeing 'firearms' show up on the field of battle and being used by both infantry and cavalry. Algiers is nothing if not adaptable and will take to integrating these new weapons into the military so that they are not chained to the combat tactics of old."
 desert_tactics: "Desert Tactics"
 desert_tactics_desc: "The unforgiving terrain of North Africa is where Algerian people call home, and with its natural harshness comes a rather inexpensive defensive measure. Fortifications are nice and good, and we will build some, but the desert is its own fortification, hand-crafted by nature itself for thousands of years."
 champion_naval_combat: "Champions of Naval Combat"
 champion_naval_combat_desc: "Trial by combat at sea is what Algerian sailors must endure, and each of our sailors that has passed the trial has proven to be a true champion out on the water. Whether they are raiding coasts, fending off enemy fleets, or doing 'private' contracts along certain trade routes, the Algerians know that they can and will be the champions of naval combat."
 algiers_city_of_refuge: "A City of Refuge"
 algiers_city_of_refuge_desc: "Algiers doesn't practice a very staunch version of Islam and the city of Algiers itself, a blossoming flower in the harshness of North Africa, is by no means a place of persecution for those seeking safety from other places.

Though some are reluctant to use such weapons, our engineers and military officers are keen on seeing how they perform in combat against our enemies; some of the wealthy individuals from our military are even willing ot put up the money to start producing such weapons inside Berar. Since it is isn't our money going into these facilities, why stop them from being built?"
 modernizing_weaponry: "Modernizing our Weapons"
 modernizing_weaponry_desc: "The age of warfare is changing all throughout India and beyond. Slowly but surely the enemies around Berar are gaining these weapons too, thus making the battlefield equal once more. We don't need this, we need to make it favored to us once again throughout investments into new military technology and refinements in our current military weapons."
 fortification_artillery: "Fortification Artillery"
 fortification_artillery_desc: "Fortifications around Berar are fine on their own, but they lack the punch to retaliate against our enemies when they come under siege. If we begin to use artillery from defensive positions from our fortifications against besieging armies, perhaps we can also use this knowledge later on when we other armies in battle? Field artillery is something of great interest to our military officers and perhaps investing in the concept now will pay off later for Berar."

 reforming_the_succession_of_berar_desc: "We must not focus purely on one aspect of Berar and neglecy others, especially when we can see the crumbling of various dynasties around us from time to time.

 meritocratic_military_organization_desc: "The time has come for us to phase out the aging method of nobles leading our armies into battle. Too many times has Berar seen its good men cut down by a leader who was supposed to be bright and capable because he was born of a grand family tree, no, this must change for the Berari military. There will be military academies set up and there will be skill-based recruitment of commanders; the nobles deserve less than we give them."

 sustain_ourselves_from_aggression_desc: "The rivals around us show no signs of resting, and neither do we. For decades now, the Berari people have focused on outward expansion and neglected to think of their own safety and their own walls that should keep them safe. Perhaps it is time for a slight shift, for, defensive measures are also in the interests of Berar, just as offensive measures are."

 coercion_leads_to_deals: "Coercion and Deals"
 coercion_leads_to_deals_desc: "Part of how Zhu Chenhao got his start in garnering support for his cause was through bribery and backroom deals with various officials in and around the Chinese courts.

The question then comes to us: Do we claim the throne and polish it in order to put proper order in where the previous emperors once faltered, or do we make a new throne for ourselves and proclaim a new age? Regardless of which we choose, our military zeal will ensure that we are successful in reaching this point, for Ning can be the only true successor in the Middle Kingdom."

It was and still is considered a great honor and a show of power to have such subjects and we are only all too willing to once again flaunt our power in this way.

People from as far as away as Sogdia came to fight for his side and Arabs fought alongside Chinese soldiers as mercenaries in the entire struggle. As such, we will cultivate a diverse military just like he did and though we may have to pay a little extra to do this, it will work to bring greater prosperity through defense and offense to the Great Yan Dynasty."

Later on though, the Shatuo Turks proved useful as military aids to various parts of the Middle Kingdom and it is that aid from the northern people that we maintain.

Nanjing, the supposed 'southern capital' is so far from us that rarely any Zhuang people have travelled to and from it, recounting it for our people in depth.

 rid_ourselves_of_tribal_complexes_desc: "Perhaps it is a reason as to why our people are so weak at promoting influence beyond Guangxi; tribes and clans from around the area we inhabit are always keen on gaining or usurping power from the others, but anytime this happens, great feuds erupt and atrocities are witnessed that should never happen. It is because of these past experiences that we must learn to transcend them and break the ties that bind us to the tribal networks of the past. It will be tough to do so, but it will be well worth the effort."

 retain_and_refine_shogongism_moism_desc: "The traditional religious practices of the Zhuang people are strange when compared to the Buddhists to the south, or the Confucians in the rest of the Middle Kingdom. Though we have adopted some practices from both regions, Moism is still prevalent in Zhuang society and with it being foundational for our people, there is a sense that it must be refined and cultivated as time goes on. If we do this and actively work to help reform it into a state religion, the Zhuang people may seen unity on yet another level crucial for sustaining a prospering state."

 peace_for_the_zhuang_people_desc: "Though some of our people have lofty ambitions for a great empire spanning to the horizons in all directions, the majority of Zhuang people simply want peace in their lives, free from the authorities from the Middle Kingdom and free from dangers elsewhere. It is this goal that we must work toward, and a peaceful existence that the Zhuang people look forward to in the ever-changing world at large."

 foundations_from_the_zhou_desc: "The Zhou Dynasty is still looked upon with prestige in the annals of history within the Middle Kingdom, and within the Zhou Dynasty came forth the designated area where we, those of the Qin Dynasty, rose up from.

 shang_yang_promoting_legalism_desc: "The type of legalism promoted by Shang Yang to the military and administration of the Qin Dynasty after the Zhou Dynasty fell from grace was the type that made the fighters of our state ruthless and efficient.

It is this legacy that we of the resurgent Qin Dynasty keep to."

 developments_of_the_qin_capital_desc: "Not only did Shang Yang promote legalism to the Qin Dynasty, he also promoted the development of the capital itself through infrastructure investments. It is through this development that he helped garner the loyalty of the people and that he helped make the Qin Dynasty prosper."

 ready_for_military_reforms_desc: "Part of the strength of the Qin Dynasty was its capability of adopting military reforms and innovations for itself as this proved crucial in the Spring and Autumn Period that preceeded the formalization of the Qin Dynasty. This spirit of adaptation in military matters is something that we are still ready for today as new technologies come to us and our officers."
 strong_political_and_peasent_base: "Strong Political and Citizen Base"
 strong_political_and_peasent_base_desc: "Legalism was foundational to our power, but it alone could not have propelled the Qin Dynasty to prominence. It was the unity sustained in the peasant class and the political class that also helped us gain authority and power and with this unity within us once more, who knows just how much power we can exude against our rivals."

 grand_position_of_the_qin_dynasty_desc: "Thanks in part to more recent technologies, the seat of the Qin Dynasty is fit not only for horse breeding, but also agricultural yields and other resource extractions.

Thus, we migrated over the centuries to where we reside currently, and though we lost many traditions from these migrations, we have gained crucial insight into moving lightly and with haste, something the others around us can't match in the slightest."

Precious metals used in various sectors of daily life, from building materials to military weapons, can be found deep within the hills which we claim as our own. By investing effort and time into mining these places, we will see profits for the Hakka people that match what is needed for a prosperous future."

We speak a different dialect and a perform different rituals and customs that may be similar to their own, but still there are differences that set us apart and leave us vulnerable to persecution, which we have endured for ages without end. Now, though, we may finally fight back and see to it that the Hakka people are not shunned and executed for being simply who they are."

 build_toulous_desc: "Tulou are traditional communal buildings built by our people for generations and they serve not only as great living spaces, but also partially as defensive structures that can help stave off enemy invasions. If we build upon this mentality and work toward making some tulou into a more defensive structure, perhaps they will prove useful as fortresses in the future. Certainly no one will see these coming as only the Hakka people have built them and readily continue to build them."

 resisting_central_chinese_authority_desc: "There is a reason why there has never been a dynasty with their capital fixed in the southern parts of the Middle Kingdom, and it is because of how resistant and distinct the south is from the north. Time and time again they have tried to rein us in, but still there is resistance and eventual autonomy given to the Yue people. Now that we are free once more, the others can be sure that they will not have an easy time taking us back into the fold."

 the_legacy_of_goujian_against_wu_desc: "One of our most famous kings, Goujian, destroyed and annexed the petty state of Wu in 473BC and set an example of just how powerful the southern people of the Middle Kingdom can be. It is partially because of his example that we continue to try to be ready militarily for whatever comes our way, lest we fail and succumb to foreign incursions or internal decadance."

 keepers_of_the_southern_waters_desc: "The waters in the south of the Middle Kingdom are rife with trade from far off places that hold several different goods and resources unique as compared to what is found locally. We must protect these trade routes and water ways from those further north so that the prosperity comes solely to us, and once that is established, naval dominance is a mere small step away."

By building relations with the Viet people and cultivating prosperous ties with key Viet officials, we can begin to bridge the gap betweent he two people groups and once again fight against the hegemony attempting to be imposed on from the north."

 blending_han_and_yue_administrations_together_desc: "The traditional administative structure of the Middle Kingdom was something foreign to the Yue people before, but as the Nanyue Kingdom became more closely tied to the Han Dynasty, the administration of both became slowly intertwined. By cultivating this blending of administrative methods more and taking the best of both sides, we can effectively govern the Yue people and state through both reformist and traditionalist methods."

 maritime_investments_desc: "The position of the Min domain is such that maritime affairs are unavoidable. Instead of doing so, we will engage with maritime trade and warfare and seek to dominate it; if we can secure the coastal waters around the Middle Kingdom for ourselves, we will have a much easier time promoting and forcing our access to the interior."

 discard_the_memory_of_the_yin_dynasty_desc: "One of the sons of Wang Shenzhi rebelled against him and proclaimed himself the 'Yin Dynasty', a bitter memory in which we are eager to stamp out entirely. It brought great disunity to the Min people; we simply can't let it happen again in any shape or form, for a united Min is what is needed, not a divided one."

 succeed_where_we_failed_southern_tang_desc: "The Southern Tang took advantage of the disunity within the Min Kingdom and our allegiance to Wuyue was not able to hold off the onslaught of the Southern Tang. We must learn from the lessons in warfare they taught us and curate a better and more robust military, starting from the core of things: the infantry."
 out_of_isolation: "Out of Isolation"
 out_of_isolation_desc: "The trade routes through the coastal waters may seem to be a good way at getting us out of isolation, but in truth they only get us contacts, not formal relations.

It was in 1279 that Hoysala Ramanatha and Rajendra Chola III were defeated by our leader, Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I, leading to the rising of the Pandyan Dynasty and the decline of the Chola Dynasty once and for all. The spirit of fighting them head on still lives on though in the people of the Pandyan Dynasty and we will need it if we are to fight back and reclaim what land is rightfully ours."

Though we have fallen much from the grace of these seven great figures in our history, we are descendants of them and thus, the embers of potential still sit within us.

They are found only within our realm and we patronize the work that goes into making temples with these characteristics, leading to not only a more devout society in terms of religion, but also a streamlined way to construct said temples (and whatever other structures use these methods) in the future."

 memories_of_civil_war_vira_and_sundara_desc: "The terrible civil war that initiated our decline in the early 14th century occurred between VIra and Sundara. The splitting of the entire nation during the civil war allowed for Ballala III from Hoysala and later Malik Kafur from the Delhi Sultanate to invade the nation, leading to a great decline in the nation over all. It is this memory that we must learn from so taht in the future, we are not so easily rocked by succession disputes or heirs claiming titles."

Pushed back to Madurai, the last remaining true heir of the three brothers that were Cheran, Cholan, and Pandyan breathes steadily, awaiting the time to slowly and carefully piece back together lands from the past. Conquest will not come about easily and the lands of our ancestors are now filled with people who would see the Pandyan Dynasty and its descendants go extinct, but we will turn the tide and spread flowers of fire against them, both from above and from above and in front of them, just as our ancestors did similar with arrows and spears."

It was they, and other members of the Ay Dynasty, that helped build up and connect the lands of Venad to other parts of Tamilakam  and when they the Ay Dynasty was partitioned in two by competing dynasties (these being the Pandyas and the Cheras), Venad helped carry forth their legacy."

Would the people of Venad once again be subject to foreign rule? The answer would be no, but the memories of the Chera Kingdom prove to be everlasting in Venad itself and as such, the rulers of our land sometimes go by the title 'Venad Cheras', giving legitimacy in the eyes of the great many who still remember the times of old."

 resisting_muslim_invasions_desc: "From far in the north did they come. Some time ago, our former ruler Aditya Varma resisted the likes of strange Muslim invaders on the borders of Venad, but that was not the last we saw of them. These Muslims often carry with them different tactics and weaponry than we of Venad are used to and as such will need to adapt to fending them off. Once we have defensive measures secured, ensuring that a defensive, well-supplied military force that can fend off any future invasions will be needed."

With their memory still around amidst the people of Kolathunad, there is a certain reputation that we have for being seen as a sort of successor to them. With this reputation, people of Tamil lineage often come to our court looking for work in a state seen as the proper successor to the Second Cheras, which we style ourselves as."

Because of this connection to the last true Chera, our ancestors obtained rights to not only temples and certain festivals, but also the legitimacy that the Chera Dynasty imposed upon its descendants.

Books and manuscripts in the languages of Thanjavur such as Sanskrit, Kannada, and Telugu are of great interest to us and also to our wider population and we should not deny the gift of knowledge to anyone in our domain. Let us continue this well-meaning patronage for the greater prosperity of Thanjavur."

 promote_an_educated_court_desc: "Just as we seek to educate the people of our land, so to do we seek to educate the people of our court.

 aided_by_vijayanagar_desc: "The Vijayanagara Empire has been one to aid us in the past, being the administrative body we once were tied and bound to. Even though times may be different, we still can implement what we learned from them and try to emulate certain parts of them, such as having an army as large as they once did. It may be a long way off, but we can at least strive for such a goal."

 build_up_gingee_fort_desc: "The fortress that is at the heart of our land is simply named: Gingee Fort. Simplistic in name, but unique in construction and layout, it serves as a model to build off of that is both uniquely defensive and self-sustaining. Using this design and of course, refining it over time will help ensure that Gingee is well proteceted and well suited to handle any future invasions."

 emulating_the_fortifications_of_gingee_desc: "The design of Gingee Fort is tough to replicate in its entirety, but our engineers are having an easier time changing it slightly to fit the various terrains present within our domain. Using this adaptation of fort designs in conjunction with how we continue to build up Gingee Fort will only mean greater results when our rivals seek to come at us."

Few remain who do not remember the times they came through and pillaged the land for whatever resources there were, and it was through these conflicts that our militaristic side grew. Even today we face these threats still, and even today we continue to fight back without backing down."

 expand_gingees_trade_sector_desc: "Trade is increasingly becoming the life-blood of several states in Southern India. Taxation has its benefits, but the waters around Southern India are highly valuable and worth so much more than simple taxation at times, so who are we to just sit around and let that trade revenue sit on its own? We are going to actively promote and invest in the Gingee trade sector, that is what we'll do! Just as our neighbors are doing for themselves!"

 far_off_relations_desc: "The trade routes and politics of our neighbors has naturally led us to meeting far off states that are unlike Gingee in the slightest. They may follow different religions, have different customs, and fight in a completely different manner, but that doesn't mean we can't try to have good tidings with them at first and later on. From first impressions to long-term diplomatic relationships, Gingee must be an expert in diplomatic matters at all times."

 techniques_of_vijayangar_desc: "Though they are unjust at times, we cannot deny the fact that the Vijayanagara Empire has had its benefits for us of Keladi.

 temple_patronage_and_constructions_desc: "To patronize and help out temples throughout Keladi is something that is natural for our rulers and as such should be continued throughout time.

 reform_agricultural_and_taxation_methods_desc: "An age old practice it is, in a sense, but it is always needed: land reform. Keladi is no different in this sense, with us needing to reform how land is distributed and tilled and taxed. Putting in the proper time and effort to ensure a new and effective system of agricultural distribution and taxation amongs the populace will ensure that Keladi can prosper from the ground up, instead of only at certain levels."

 adaptation_of_firearms_desc: "With the introduction of firearms all around states in India, it is no new fact that the soldiers of Carnatic are already experimenting with how they can be used and improved for later on.

 fortifications_of_arcot_desc: "For a long time, Arcot at the heart of our nation has been a sight of great fortifications. They have been compounded upon over the decades, and still prove effective in preparing the defenders of Carnatic for whatever may come for them.

Since his establishment of the Lion Throne of the Maldives, we have honored his legacy and kept his memory intact throughout time, with our rulers paying respect to him just as the common people do.

Trading with those we share a faith with is easy, is it not?"

 arabic_ties_and_administrative_tongue_desc: "The Arabic language is used extensively throughout the Maldives but our own language still prevails alongside Arabic. By using Arabic, however, we are able to utilize more innovations in administrative affairs that they bring along and truly there some astounding innovations that comes to us from the likes of Arabia itself. We'd be wise to use these in our own governing body."
 capitalize_on_our_importance: "Capitalize on our Importance"
 capitalize_on_our_importance_desc: "To say the Maldives is important is putting it lightly. We are a key stopping point for several trade routes and for good reasons. If we can capitalize on this fact and ensure that trade in the Maldives is safe and prosperous, more and more people will come to us to conduct mercantile agreements and trade overall. We can become a true economic powerhouse if we just learn how to utilize our position well."

True to our nature as an economic and trading giant in the Indian Ocean, we will make sure that the export of these fine goods is not hindered in the slightest, but rather increased as time goes on so that the Maldives can continue it's overall dominance."

It was not, however, destined to last as some centuries later, it all came apart in a disastrous civil war, causing the cities to break away one by one.

 three_hearts_three_cities_desc: "Some call them our three hearts, but in reality they are our three key cities. Cempoala (the place of twenty waters) was the nominal ruler of the Totonacapan Kingdom; Teayo (tortoise atop stone) is the place where we see a mix of various cultures such as Toltax, Mexica, and Huastec; and Tajin is perhaps our greatest city, being inhabited for countless generations (until being burned down in a fire in the 1200's) and being situated along key trade routes along with preserving leftovers from the ancient city of Teotihuacan. With all the successor to Taijin along with the other two cities working together in harmony, we will be able to plan and develop Totonac culture and society further than we've ever thought possible."

 non_human_sacrifices_desc: "Contrary to those around us such as the Aztecs, we do not practice human sacrifice... All the time. Our goddess of maize deemed such sacrifices unworthy and not needed, so instead we give herbs, flowers, and animal sacrifices instead. Such people who might normally be used for human sacrifices can instead be put to work in Totonac society instead, developing the land that is uncultivated... And if they disobey, the god of the sun will have them and their hearts."

We must begin to build and keep a unique cultural identity compared to those around us and make our court distinctivly Totonac, rather than perhaps Aztec, Huastec, or Zapotec. It will take some time, but our court will become the bastion and beacon of Totonac culture, long enough for others to sprout up elsewhere."

 against_the_aztecs_desc: "That triple alliance to the west of us... It threatens our very way of life. Totonac warriors, priests, and commoners alike know the threat the Aztecs are when they are united and this alliance that has formed is nothing short of a ticking threat waiting to exterminate the Totonac people. We need to harden ourselves and prepare our warriors for a fearless campaign against them and any who would support them, and even when the Aztecs are defeated, we must still ready ourselves for what other threats to the Totonacs there may be."

 rebuilding_taijin_desc: "Burned down in a fire so long ago, but still within our memory. Tajin must not ever be forgotten and its place must be kept sacred within the hearts of the Totonac people. Rebuilding it will be a large undertaking, but completing it will assure us the loyalty and unity of the Totonac people altogether. Let us go forth and trace our steps back to our foundation, and mend the cracks that are there, freeing Totonac society to be whole once again."

 tight_administrative_structure_desc: "Through the nature of how the Matlatzinca people live in the Toluca Valley, the administrative structure has to be close-knit and centralized.

From here, and with the mythical foundation of the large stone split in half with the name of the Stone of the Sun, we claim even greater religious authority, but this time branching into the Zapotec area of things.

We oversaw great swaths of land and dictated military endeavors and trade routes from several places, but that time is well past us now.

 natural_terrain_knowledge_desc: "The varied terrain of Chanda is such that we have needed to learn how to deal with flooding, heat, tropical conditions, shifting heights in the terrain, and more.

 institute_garhs_desc: "Garhs are a way of organizing fortification managment and upkeep around the land and it involves the use of various clans that we rule over.

 gond_clan_organization: "Gond Clan Organization"
 gond_clan_organization_desc: "The way Gond clans are organized can be confusing to some, especially those outside of the subcontinent, but it is not impossible to learn nor is it impossible to formalize. Our interest lies in formalizing their structure and position inside our realm so that they do not grow too powerful nor do they feel disenfranchised; it's a tough balancing act, but it's one we must commit to if we are to be successful in this world."
 malvi_authorities: "Malvi Authorities"
 malvi_authorities_desc: "The authority from the Sultanate of Malwa is overbearing at times, but it does bring with it benefits that we would not otherwise get to see. One of these benefits is the introduction of firearms to the state of Garha, and in seeing how useful they've been for the Malvi people, using it for ourselves could make things all the more easier when fighting other powers around. Perhaps, in time, we could even turn these firearms on those who introduced us to them."

 rebels_against_bahmanis_desc: "Our foundation as a seperate entity in the region comes from when the governor of Daulatabad, Bahram Khan Mazindarani, rose up against the Bahmani ruler along with Malik Raja and powers from Berar and Baglana. Though the rebellion failed, it set in motion what would allow Malik Raja to separate Khandesh away from Bahmanis and other powers into a completely independent state, and, though this would change inevitably later on, it helped set a precedent for our people in the future."

 satiate_the_minorities_desc: "Like many other sultanates before Khandesh, the minorities of Hindustan are plentiful, seeking both recognition and local power when they are conquered (that is, if they do not revolt or have their revolts suppressed). Being as traditional sultanates are, we seek to work with and accept these minority groups rather than to alienate them, thus bringing Khandesh into a greater state of ease and promoting better social cohesion."

One essential part that we have put work into integrating into Gwalior is the effective tax system they left behind, meaning we are able to obtain much higher revenues from the people of our land than other states around us."

Still, Virashimha was not executed and he worked tirelessly to undermine Delhi's efforts to integrate and keep hold of Gwalior, to which he obtained success some years later.

Though many states will reject said dissidents, why should Gwalior? We revolted from Delhi, we should be a practical haven for these kinds of people! And we can make good use of them and obtain connections, both shady and formal, with powers around the subcontinent and perhaps even beyond."

 improving_defensive_measures_desc: "The central fortress, Gwalior Fort, is key to our power, certainly, but there is more to us than that central fort. With a defensive mentality in mind, we must prepare a more stringent and effective defense in our homeland so that any invaders will suffer even more when coming through. Partisan attacks, strange explosives buried in the ground that explode with enough pressure, and traps at various points, all can be employed by Gwalior to help thwart foreign invasions."

We are not full Rajputs ourselves, but we have taken after several traditions and customs that the Rajputs themselves have, including around diplomacy. Though we have refined it over the years, this sort of Rajput diplomacy for the people of Gwalior is flexible and our policies are more fluid than in other states around us so that we can adapt to changing circumstances, whatever they may be."

 rao_underneath_the_sisodias_desc: "Our ruler, when underneath the leaders of Mewar, take on the title of Rao (a different form of Raja). With this in mind, we are designated more toward maintaining the lands that Mewar cannot govern themselves and thus must learn to field more military regiments in a more refined manner, thus keeping this land under lock-and-key and safely producing revenue."

 legacy_of_the_meena_tribe_desc: "Before the time of the Rajput invasion of this land, there was the Meena tribe who stayed here, claiming descent all the way back toward the Matsya Kingdom. Though most are gone from power now in Hadoti, some still remain as prominent members of Hadoti society and their legacy of having more respect for women than more traditional Hindu states is felt throughout all of Hadoti, especially in our own court."
 rajput_meena_intermingling: "Rajput-Meena Intermingling"
 rajput_meena_intermingling_desc: "The two groups may have fought each other to a bloody end in the previous centuries, but that time is over now. We must work on reconciling these differences within Hadoti itself and also work on enjoining these two populations into one cohesive unit that Hadoti can rely on, for, times of war and times of disaster do not discriminate based on tribal or clan membership, they take from and stike at anyone and everyone."

 handing_down_of_martial_traditions_desc: "Our connections with Mewar have been strong in the past, and as a result of this strong connection with them there has been a mutual exchange of knowledge between Hadoti and its overlord. The martial training and traditions from the Rajput heartland are plentiful and the military of Hadoti is ever thankful that they are included in the sharing these traditions."
 dynastic_support_from_mewar: "Dynastic Support"
 dynastic_support_from_mewar_desc: "When push came to shove in the past for Hadoti, the royals of Mewar could be relied on for backing up our claims or our side in a dispute. We can still use this leverage today or perhaps even rely on our own connections not in the royals of Mewar to bolster our own dynasty, especially on the international stage."
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans: "Cultivation of Rajput Clans"
 cultivation_of_rajput_clans_desc: "The plentiful clans of Rajput people are ready to serve Hadoti, they simply need to be organized and given strong leadership from us. Our own efforts to institute viable candidates for leadership are going well so far and the beneficial relationship between the Hadoti government and the clans is infact helping things progress, so we should expect the Rajput powerbase within us expand and be ready for future conflicts."

 taking_after_the_sisodias_desc: "The Sisodias of Mewar were unique in several ways, one of which was in how illustrious they were and how they tried to make themselves out to be above other Rajput clans through poetry and other art forms. Perhaps it is time that those of Hadoti do the same? We could separate ourselves from the other clans, rise above them, and promote the royalty of Hadoti as the grand and true leaders, above all others... It sounds nice, doesn't it?"

 rajput_and_malvi_influences_desc: "We are at the confluence of both Rajput communities and incoming Malvi influences from the east. Both hold great sway in Baglana and both at times create friction when they meet each other, but when combined properly, they create a militaristic nature that is unlike anything around us. Baglana can only benefit from such a combination of forces."
 the_fake_subject_state: "The Fake Subject"
 the_fake_subject_state_desc: "Previous invaders have come through our land and subjugated a few chiefs and simply thought that the entirety of Baglana was underneath them, but they were greatly mistaken. Tribute to be paid? Irregular at best. Troops to be levied? Maybe, maybe not. Baglana has always been a tenuous, or rather, fake subject state and it will continue to be so, inspiring our people to strive for freedom from these incursions against us."
 our_natural_terrain: "Our Natural Terrain"
 our_natural_terrain_desc: "The terrain of Baglana is not forgiving to those who are new to it. Mountains and valleys and fertile plains all scattered about in Baglana, and we know how to best use them in a defensive strategy as well as navigate them for troop movements. Others who might invade us know very little of these routes we take and as such we will take advantage of this."
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates: "Pirates? With Baglana?"
 leagued_with_western_shore_pirates_desc: "With how scattered some of our cities and communities are, it should come as no surprise that those of Baglana have shady connections all around, especially with raiders and pirates. The western coast has been a haven for us in this regard and we are willing to make these contracts with pirates and raiders into something more formal so that all of Baglana can benefit."
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja: "Rein in the Chiefs of Baglana"
 rein_in_the_chiefs_under_the_raja_desc: "The myriad of chiefs throughout Baglana are capable of causing issues at times with the central government, and the Raja is not always able to calm them down through peaceful means. There must be expeditions sent out to formally subjugate and bring these chiefs underneath the flag of Baglana so that they do not stir up trouble beneath the Raja or in the communities that are loyal to the Raja."
 rivals_in_khandesh: "Rivals in Khandesh"
 rivals_in_khandesh_desc: "Khandesh has been a staunch rival of ours for decades now, being one to launch attacks against us and the Gujarati people to our northwest. They think they can easily come through Baglana and tear down what we've worked on for so long, but they couldn't be more wrong. The people of Baglana are ready and willing to take up arms at every point against these invaders and Khandesh will be the first to know this."
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana: "Reshaping the Military of Baglana"
 reshape_military_ranks_in_baglana_desc: "By now we have noticed the faults in the army of Baglana, one of which is the fact that payment and service is not nearly as formal as it should be. If we can organize military matters into something centralized and cohesive, we'll benefit from a better quality army that can do more work than a simple levy-based army of irregularly trained soldiers."

 malla_kings_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our lineage of rulers are known as the 'Malla Kings' and their lineage stretches all the way back toward a little before the 8th century. Such a long and strong line of succession makes Bishnupur ingrained in the people it rules over; the people have faith in the royal lineage and know it well enough to have a good amount of trust in the ones who have ruled over Mallabhum for so long."
 the_isolation_of_bishnupur: "The Isolation of Bishnupur"
 the_isolation_of_bishnupur_desc: "Our homeland is quite isolated from other communities and states and rarely do people come through our lands to invade or even trade. This isolation isn't completely bad for Bishnupur since it has allowed us to cultivate a grand defensive mentality and structure that few can match."
 praying_to_bipodtarini_devi: "To Bipodtarini Devi"
 praying_to_bipodtarini_devi_desc: "Our kings are often associated with Bipodtarini Devi, who is considered one of the 108 avatars of the goddess Durga. She is closely linked with the concept of overcoming troubles and often prayed to for this, and thus as our kings are associated with this, they too should be looked up to in order to help overcome struggles, thus in part promoting the relation with Bipodtarini Devi."
 abiding_by_the_mallabda_calendar: "The Mallabda Calendar"
 abiding_by_the_mallabda_calendar_desc: "We have developed a unique calendar in Bishnupur that is unlike most others (though somewhat related to other Bengali calendars). By keeping it in use within our own population and spreading its use to others within our borders, we can have a unified system of dates that cause little confusion to those throughout."
 terracotta_craftwork: "Terracota Work"
 terracotta_craftwork_desc: "One of the two things Bishnupur is certainly famous for is its work in terracotta craft.

 tension_in_the_west_desc: "The western corridor for us is rife with tensions, what with the Adal Sultanate fighting the Ethiopians in a bloody and drawn out feud. We must prepare ourselves to take advantage of the fallout from this ongoing conflict, for if we conduct ourselves properly in both the daylight and the shadows, none will be able to stop us from taking what they leave behind and more."

 questions_in_the_north_desc: "The northern coasts of Arabia have always been in question to us of Warsangali. There are powers there that could help us in both military aspects and trading aspects, but there are also several powers to choose from. Whoever we do end up choosing, let us make sure we are able to make good friends with them in a quick fashion."

If we can at least make sure the parts that run through Majeerteen are safe and paved and overall of better quality than those around us, we'll attract more traders and merchants from all over the region and beyond."

 robust_infrastructure_developments_desc: "We know just how important infrastructure is and how vital things like sanitation, education, and housing are to the regular citizens of Majeerteen.

 reaching_out_for_trade_agreements_desc: "Like many before us, being on the coast of Africa means that we need to reach out across the open water to obtain friendship as well as profitable trade agreements.

 naval_efforts_of_majeerteen_desc: "We would not be a true Somali Sultanate if we did not bolster our naval force to some degree. The time has finally come to invest in our sailors and ships so that they do not falter when on the high seas when trading or when in combat against rival navies."

 centralized_authority_in_majeerteen_desc: "By reforming the authority within Majeerteen over time and putting an emphasis on bureaucracy over tribal politics, we will see a less unrest within the sultanate as well as increased influence in local politics. We'd rather have ourselves influencing the people of Majeerteen as opposed to possible insurgents hidden within the local chiefs."

 establish_a_modern_sultanate_desc: "With changing times comes changing technologies and ways of thought.

 establish_the_majeerteen_military_desc: "The military of Majeerteen has never been anything that stands out in comparison to other Somali states, but we know this cannot last. Naval warfare is important, but taking land that is away from the coast is also very important and a strong military will be needed for that.

The dynamics of these shifts aren't always clear, but the military is always involved in some form. By ensuring that the military is at least curtailed and not capable of seizing all power in Kalahandi, but is actually integrated properly within the state itself, we can organize it in a much better fashion."

 garjati_adaptive_warfare_desc: "The tropical climate of the Garjati homes are not home to the most stable fighting grounds. Often there are uneven hills, sudden ridges, dense jungles, and uncultivated areas that make warfare much more small-scale and scattered.

 revive_the_military_prowess_from_ramai_deva_desc: "The disciplined state Ramai Deva created in his time must not be forgotten, especially in the vein of our military.

 cultivation_of_keonjhar: "Cultivation of Keonjhar"
 cultivation_of_keonjhar_desc: "There is a need for us to build up the central structure of Keonjhar beyond just a petty village.

If this can be satisfied, then perhaps our raja can become more than what he currently is."

 coming_together_of_various_traditions_desc: "Just as past powers came for Jeypore, various cultures left their mark too and even today we experience a vast amount of varied cultural influence.

 reform_the_dynastic_succession: "Reforming the Succession"
 reform_the_dynastic_succession_desc: "To us the way of succession in Jeypore is often messy and chaotic and often times it leads to issues regarding power and money.

 plentiful_mercenary_contracts_desc: "With the acceptance of various cultures comes the arrival of various warriors for hire.

 succeeding_the_patna_state: "Succeeding the Patna State"
 succeeding_the_patna_state_desc: "The decline of the Patna state may be seen as inevitable to some, but for us, it is a somber story that comes to a close.

 taming_the_garjat_states: "Taming of the Garjat States"
 taming_the_garjat_states_desc: "Picking up where our ancestors in Patna left off, it is our duty to stabilize the inner areas of Odisha and to put down the ambitions of petty chiefs and local rulers.

 reinvigorate_bhati_rajputs_desc: "For too long we have been put down by other rajput clans and take advantage of by neighboring powers.

 jauhar_desc: "This seemingly horrid act is a form self-immolation by Hindu women in particular in order avoid capture, enslavement, and other atrocities that could be committed by hostile forces seeking them out in the midst of certain defeat (that is, defeat on the side of the Hindu women). This act has mostly been seen occurring during the various Muslim invasions of the subcontinent and there have been prominent cases of jauhar happening in Jaisalmer's history.

 anti_siege_attacks_desc: "We have since our inception been forced to learn the ways of siege warfare and it isn't easy in the slightest. What we have learned, however, is that sorties and anti-siege attacks from within and from outside fortifications can be extremely useful and it's something we of Jaisalmer should perfect. How and where can we practice? Jaisalmer Fort is a prime target."

 resurgence_of_the_bhati_rajputs_desc: "The time has now come to proclaim a new age for the rajput people.

 rajput_conflicts_desc: "The rajput are rarely ever truly united on a single cause. Clans will disagree greatly on one matter or another and it's only when there is a common enemy for all rajputs that we have seen unity amongst all clans.

 secular_practices_in_government: "Secular Practices in Government"
 secular_practices_in_government_desc: "In a land of many faiths such as Northern India, there is a need to separate the religion of the land and the people from the work done in the administration.

 encompassing_many_faiths: "Encompassing Many Faiths"
 encompassing_many_faiths_desc: "There is no need to promote intolerance amongst the society in Oudh, not when we have seen what intolerance in India has done to other states.

 resist_incursions_against_rohillas_desc: "There will be those who think they can invade Rohilkhand and subjugate the Rohilla people with little resistance.

 legacy_of_mewati_rebellion_desc: "Even in the past, when Delhi sultans tried to rein us back into their domain, we resisted to the very ened and sought to keep our independence from them. This rebellious mentality can be transformed into a defensive mentality and harden our resolve to defend our land through both innovations in fortifications and defensive tactics."
 blending_of_identities: "Blending of Identities"
 blending_of_identities_desc: "Just as we blended the identities of being a Muslim with being a rajput, we can also begin to incorporate and accept others into the Mewati domain.

 nagpur_states_desc: "The various states of the Orissa region are divided amongst themselves heavily and are seen as hard to control by outsiders, but we come from the same land the divided people do.

 marathi_cavalry_connection_desc: "The heavy cavalry of older states is increasingly becoming useless as time goes on.

 light_warfare: "Light Warfare"
 light_warfare_desc: "The terrain of Surguja's homeland makes formalized warfare hard to do, so we've had to adapt to irregular and light warfare as a result.

We have options, plenty of them, but managing them carefully and with ease is something else entirely and it requires a dedicated diplomatic building and group of people who are specially trained in the field of diplomacy.

The Ifat Sultanate may be gone now, but their legacy of having a fighting spirit against their religious enemies is still imbued within the people of Shewa today."

 history_of_religious_conflict_desc: "Islam and Christianity in this region mix like water and oil, and in the realm of politics, react with flowers of fire and destruction. The people of Shewa are no stranger to this and despite their defensive position in the highlands, still experience the troubles of religious conflict. We must not hide our face from it, no, we must charge at it head-on without fear of death or defeat!"

 memory_of_the_makhzumi_dynasty_desc: "There once was an independent Muslim Shewa Sultanate, back from around the 900s to upon the conquests westward by the Ifat Sultanate in the 1200s. Though the dynasty from that era, the Makhzumi, is no longer around, it's legacy lives on today in the people of our land. They strive for greatness and they uphold the dynasty properly, just as the dynasty in exchange upholds the people of Shewa."

 tensions_with_the_oromo_desc: "The Oromo are more than a small issue, they are a contentious ethnic group that often seek to migrate and settle in places that are already inhabited by others, especially Amhara people akin to our own. We need a system of some kind to distinguish between the Oromo and Amhara, a line of separation so that we can root out troubled parts of our state that are most likely Oromo in nature. They've caused issues for us and other Amhara states in the past, we will learn from their failures in this area."
 defense_over_offense: "Defense over Offense"
 defense_over_offense_desc: "The inherent position of Shewa makes defensive strategies more viable and conquest of the land harder. At times the people here have been isolated from the rest of the region and at other times they have been connected somewhat, but the fact remains that defensive placements and a defensive mentality are key to the survival of Shewa."

 religious_deliberation_desc: "Navigating the waters of religious tension in the region Shewa finds itself in is no easy matters. Siding with one side or the other will invoke the ire of another side and possible revolts throughout the land or it could invoke retribution from outside the state. Regardless of the dangers, we must be ready to consider carefully the actions we take in the future regarding religion in Shewa, and how we will go about enforcing a state-sponsored religion."

Its custody and protection and ownership remains a large subject in several circles in our own nation as it gives us both prestige and reputation amongst other Islamic nations. On top of this, the firm control over the two sites gives us a degree of religious authority, attracting a number of Islamic scholars and imams of which some wish to spread the message of Islam to other lands.

Islamic conquest carried out by them is not lost on us and we are set on reviving it. Already there are soldiers of ours who deem in an honor to conquer in the name of Islam, yet restraint must be maintained with even the most zealous of soldiers in our service. Conquest must not mean brutal population treatment, but rather working with them and working to bring them into the wider Islamic world."

 arabian_trade_connections_desc: "For centuries, Arabian merchants travelled along the coasts of the Indian Ocean to far away lands, sharing and gathering information along the way whilst also spreading the word of Islam to new communities along the way. Though spreading the word of the prophet is certainly needed, we must not forget these trade connections in the slightest. The revenue they can bring for us if utilized well enough is not insignificant and by connectiing with the scattered trade-based Islamic communities that have sprouted up throughout the centuries, we will be able to extract greater amounts of revenue yet."

 refine_and_transcend_clan_loyalties_desc: "Tribes and clans of the Arabian Peninsula are numerous and scattered, but they hold significant sway in deciding local matters from places such as San'a, Muscat, Jabal Shammar, and many more. We must communicate clearly with them, establish good relations with the tribes and clans, and ensure that they are loyal to the higher authorities of the land. If we can do this properly, then several local matters in villages and cities will be of little worry compared to if we were actively fighting said tribes and clans."

Whether it was one tribe versus another or Sunnis versus Shiites versus Ibadis, the entirety of the region has known little peace since the time of the last great Caliphate. Now though, through our hard work and astute leadership, we have become the catalayst and the holders of a new golden era of the Arabian Peninsula that sees not division and destruction, but rather cooperation and prosperity. With this, we will do all that we can to defend what we have fought so hard for; and when our enemies are driven back from our great home, we will be sure they never threaten us again."

Later on, the Buyid Dynasty as well as the Seljuk Turks continued to build up the splendor and prosperity of Isfahan, culminating into its greatest form under Malik-Shah I (reigned 1073-1092). Though the times are very much different now and cities like Tabriz are taking over, we can very much still build our home city into something as great or even greater than what it once was. Our past tells us of what we are capable of, and it is our past that can help lead us into the future."

Thus, the goal is clear for us: build up high quality and strong defensive structures along key points so that we can maintain our invaluable position in the mountains.

Why, it is the wondrous architecture of course! The Perso-Islamic style that we have begun to cultivate and promote throughout the entirety of the city and elsewhere is showing more and more people just how illustrious of a city Isfahan is, and with more prestige comes more influence in foreign states. Perhaps in time, others of signficant status will come to admire our hard work and use the wisdom we use in our grand structures."

This blending of cultures is not a new notion in the slightest as the Sassanid Empire had a sizeable Jewish community settle within the limits of Isfahan at the time. By continuing this idea of cultural cooperation and understanding, we can be ready to take in new people whenever they come into our fold."

Already we are making strides to retake the prominent position we once had and already many around us are seeing us as a respectable state for the region itself. With this in mind, states beyond our home region are even noticing us and sending a plethora of merchants our way in order to do business. Who are we to deny them this lucrative right?

Seeing that arrangements were well and good, and because we were not in any position to really resist, we agreed and became subjects for generations on end. Now though, the Mongols are broken and shattered, scavenging for resources and leadership whilst the Buryats roam free again.

The coastal cities are lucrative for trade and havens for corsairs whilst the inner desert sands are home to roaming tribes of Berbers that are quite hard to control. This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli.

 rajput_divisions_in_cutch: "Rajput Divisions Internally"
 rajput_divisions_in_cutch_desc: "The Rajputs tribes and clans that have come to the Gujarati region are entrenched and crucial to politics, military matters, and even diplomatic affairs. Kutch, however, is a victim of their rather consistent in-fighting and feuds that result in a great amount of strain on the administration. We need to work to control these internal divisions and help workout solutions for the various clans so that they can cooperate and unite under one banner instead of fighting each other."
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch: "Curbing Tribal Politics"
 curb_tribal_politics_in_cutch_desc: "To transcend tribal politics is marvelous, but getting there is an entirely different story. Whether it is by strict treatment or peaceful negotiations, we need to ensure that the word of the Kutchi administration comes before the word of chiefs and clan leaders, ensuring a strong path to proper governance from a central authority."
 the_dwarkadhish_temple_of_gujarat: "Protect the Dwarkadhish Temple"
 the_dwarkadhish_temple_of_gujarat_desc: "The city Dwarka and its temple of Dwarkadhish is part of Sapta Puri, the seven holy pilgrimage sites in the lands of the subcontinent. Every year Hindus from all walks of life travel to here to pay homage to their faith, meaning that protecting it is of the utmost importance for us. Doing so will not only grant us a good name amongst Hindu communities elsewhere, but it will also help show how devoted we are to the people of our land."
 fortifications_against_raids: "Fortifications against Raids"
 fortifications_against_raids_desc: "Raids from the north are common enough to warrant special attention from the Kutchi administration. For too long we have suffered at the hands of the Sindhi people at the mouth of the Indus River, we must not let their raids beat our people down forever. By expanding our curent and future fortifications with extra garrisons and more effective construction techniques, we can put up a much stronger fight against these fiends."
 patrons_of_ashapura_mata: "Patrons of Ashapura Mata"
 patrons_of_ashapura_mata_desc: "She is the principle deity of our land, the land of Kutch and all of the Gujarati region surrounding it. Ashapura Mata (sometimes known as Kuldevi) is the one we must pay special attention to and whose temples we must be the largest patrons of. Doing so will earn us good favor with our own people both of high and low status, for most if not all the people of Kutch and Gujarat uphold the rulers who put their trust in the goddess who fulfills wishes and desires."
 ceramic_and_glass_interests: "Ceramic and Glass Interests"
 ceramic_and_glass_interests_desc: "As of late, there has been an increased interest in the likes of the upper class of Kutch in regards to making glass of various types and also ceramics. While some are skeptical as to how profitable such endeavors would be in our land, we can easily see that in the coming decades, such products will be highly sought after. We would do well to capitalize on this glass and ceramic idea now before it is too late."
 maritime_ambitions: "Maritime Ambitions of Kutch"
 maritime_ambitions_desc: "The last avenue many see for Kutch is the aspect of maritime trade and connections. Reaching out and connecting with the various lucrative trade ports and helping improve the mercantile sector of our own state should be a priority since in the past we have barely profited at all in this respect."

 working_as_a_vassal: "Working as a Vassal"
 working_as_a_vassal_desc: "When the Muzaffarid Dynasty came to power in Ahmedabad, they exerted a great amount of power over the region of Saurashtra peninsula area within the Gujarat region. We of Junagadh have not had luck in fighting them off and as such have served as their subject in the past. Though this isn't ideal, it has allowed us to become flexible and capable in terms of negotiations and diplomacy, something that few others in our home region know how to do properly."
 descendants_of_yadu: "Descendants of the Yadu Tribe"
 descendants_of_yadu_desc: "The Yadu Tribe is the descendant of Yadu himself, whom is mentioned in the Mahabharata, the Harivamsha, and the Puranas. From him and his descedants came forth the Yadavas and the Yadu Tribe and we trace our ancestry back to this very group, lending us credibility and prestige in the eyes of our local region."
 age_old_conflicts: "Age Old Conflicts"
 age_old_conflicts_desc: "From centuries ago we have had conflict on our borders. For so long we have fought against the Chaulukya kings of Gujarat and though they may be gone, new conflicts sparked as soon as the Muslims made their way to power. We must never let our guard down against new foes that come to our border; Junagadh is never quite safe from enemy incursions."
 junagadh_coins: "Junagadh Coinage"
 junagadh_coins_desc: "Copper coins are common place in Junagadh and we are slowly incorporating other types of coins from surrounding areas into our own. We need to ensure that the supply and demand of our coins is in a constant balance and also that new coins are minted for each and every new ruler that rises to power. It will take some time to refine our system to this standard, but it will be worth it in the end."
 uparkot_fort_and_junagadh: "Constructions of Junagadh"
 uparkot_fort_and_junagadh_desc: "The fortresses and stepwells built in Junagadh are good enough as it is, but we should not be content with pure functionality. If we are to be safe and prosperous, we need to work on getting higher quality building materials and also more innovative designs for our structures so that we do not fall behind others around in terms of city planning, internal growth, and external defense."

 against_the_sultans_desc: "Previous rulers of ours have tried to assert control over the Gulf of Khambhat, but the sultans that reign from Ahmedabad have turned our people back every single time. That does not deter us, however, and our ambitions still lie in the destruction of the power those fiendish sultans have and uniting our home region under one authority. If this takes years or decades to happen, then so be it."
 pirates_of_gujarat: "Pirates of Gujarat"
 pirates_of_gujarat_desc: "In order to weaken the power of the Gujarat sultans, our previous leaders attempted to perform piracy against them in and around the Gulf of Khambhat. Though some see piracy as a petty measure that won't get very far, we are convinced that it can and will help force other nations around us into submission or at the very least to the negotiating table."
 descendant_states: "Descendant States"
 descendant_states_desc: "Many members of the Gohil Dynasty have branched off and created small states within our land, uniting more rural communities under themselves and acting as a sort of administrative division for us as a whole. Uniting them under a firm top-down administration that can work effectively and coherently will allow us to draw on the power they have stored up."
 controlling_saurashtra: "Controlling Saurashtra"
 controlling_saurashtra_desc: "The nature of Saurashtra has been divided for a great many years. Few if any have ever united for long and even when they did, it was still rife with communal or tribal feuds that often hindered the productivity of the land itself. Control, then, must not come from outside the region, but rather from inside the region itself, and who better than those of Palitana? Under our guidance, we can ensure a righteous and profitable future for the strategically situated cities through the region."
 money_for_life: "Money for Life"
 money_for_life_desc: "Palitana can focus on the lucrative side of things once the politics of Saurashtra are sorted. Ensuring that monetary practices are flowing smoothly, that trade is without hinderance, and that our production methods are being consistently refined will help attract foreign investors and traders. If we can round everything out, Palitana will be set for a grand future."

We have not forgotten what we once had under our control and we will actively fight for it at every point. Once Kathiawar is under our control, we will then go forth and do what they did to us: take the homelands from which they rose from."

 defeated_but_not_dead_desc: "Our string of defeats in the past set us back to the very brink of extinction. Few if any wanted the Jethwa Dynasty around, but we held on despite the incursions against us. We will rise once more, take back what is rightfully ours, and see to it that the land is reclaimed in the name of the Jethwa Dynasty!"
 contention_over_saurashtra: "Kathiawar Contention"
 contention_over_saurashtra_desc: "Since our defeats, many tribes and states have risen up in the ashes and they all claim to be the future rulers of Kathiawar, but we cannot let these ambitions block our path. We must show no mercy to them when they fight us for hegemony, and we must show no mercy when we face the likes of the Gujarat Sultanate."
 jethwa_cities_reborn: "Jethwa Cities Reborn"
 jethwa_cities_reborn_desc: "Many of the cities around Kathiawar were the established by our ancestors, those of the Jethwa Dynasty. Though they do not know us as leaders anymore, they will soon, and when they come back into our fold, the cities will be born anew and rise up like never before. Pretender states may have taken these cities for themselves for now, but they will not last long."
 jethwas_triumphant: "Triumph of the Jethwas"
 jethwas_triumphant_desc: "How will we triumph over our enemies? How will we take what was once ours? It will be through discipline and martial prowess as that is what made us crumble into pieces so long ago. There will be reforms to our military and proper organiztion so that our armies can outdo the quality of our rivals; none will stand in the path of the Jethwa Dynasty from coming back into power."

 destroyers_of_the_pajang_kingdom_desc: "The Pajang Kingdom came before us and they were not fit to hold the seat of power in Java. Vulnerable to civil conflicts and political disputes, we of Mataram rose up from the splits in their political structure and founded a new state, one that can effectively rule Java unlike any other."
 to_subjugate_java: "Subjugating Java"
 to_subjugate_java_desc: "Java itself is a land of great riches, but Mataram's inland home is not ripe for taking hold of the edges of the grand island. Our slow but sure progress on the island will be marked with celebrations and a restructuring of the old societal ways so that they can be revamped into something more suitable for Mataram."
 learning_inland_fighting: "Learning Inland Fighting"
 learning_inland_fighting_desc: "The lands of Java are harsh for making military movements and sieges. They require hefty planning and can often take a larger toll on the military than one might expect. It is because of this that we of Mataram need to learn how to effectively conduct war on Java so that when we invade elsewhere, we can use what we learned before and thus gain an advantage."
 cut_down_unruly_subjects: "Cut Down Internal Threats"
 cut_down_unruly_subjects_desc: "Time and time again, powers on Java have been undermined by the fact that internal politics fluctuate to a great degree. Various marriages, weak authority, and people supporting pretenders to the throne have dealt deathly blows to previous powers on Java, but Mataram will be different! It will seek to tackle these threats before they can get time to flourish!"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority: "Mataram Absolutism"
 ruling_with_absolute_authority_desc: "Unlike our predecessors, we will ensure that our authority is known throughout all of our lands. Java is a land that will chew up and spit out weak states without mercy; Mataram must prove itself worthy to be spared from this fate through thorough administrative reforms and absolute authority from the monarch."
 holy_wars_of_mataram: "Holy Wars of Mataram"
 holy_wars_of_mataram_desc: "Hindus and Christians alike, they seek to claim the lands around us when in fact, they are rightfully belonging to the most powerful state on Java, that being Mataram! They know no discipline or respect for us in the slightest, not even for Islam, and for that they must die!"
 the_imogiri_burial_place: "Imogiri"
 the_imogiri_burial_place_desc: "A place to remember our past rulers, great and small, that is what Imogiri is and forever shall be. No ruler of Mataram will be placed elsewhere and as our lineage continues to grow and prosper, the complex of Imogiri will be expanded steadily.

 alongside_majapahit: "Alongside Majapahit"
 alongside_majapahit_desc: "Our roots lay in the foundations of the Majapahit Empire and its founder, Raden Wijaya, in the late 1290s. Our land was seen as a vassal of sorts to the core of Majapahit and it developed steadily alongside the heart of the once great empire. It is through this development and showing of strength with little in the way of actual help of Majapahit that Blambangan shall thrive; we are in no need of being as subject once more."
 remember_the_paregreg_war: "Memories of the Paregreg War"
 remember_the_paregreg_war_desc: "The Paregreg War of 1404-1406 was a civil war within the Majaphit Empire that was mainly over the rivalry between the courts of Majapahit (Western Court, led by Wikramawardhana) and Blambangan (Eastern Court, led by Bhre Wirabhumi). It shows just how influential and powerful the area of Blambangan had become, and though we lost back then to the Majapahit Empire, the memory of this period in history brings a sense of legitimacy to the administration of Blambangan today."
 lonely_hindu_kingdom: "The Lonley Hindu Kingdom"
 lonely_hindu_kingdom_desc: "With the loss of Majapahit and the decline of the Sunda Kingdom, Blambangan is one of the only Hindu states left on Java. In our lonesome state, we face threats from all directions since they would see the last vestige of the Majapahit Empire taken over and executed out of existence. Let us set up tall walls, defensive positions, and effective strategies to counter these invasive plans so that Blambangan can withstand these threats. We will not fall to what lies beyond our own coast."
 fending_off_foreign_interests: "Fending off Foreigners"
 fending_off_foreign_interests_desc: "The foreign forces that seek to control Java for themselves are seeking to stifle our power and our prosperity in every way possible. Our military must be ready for when our navy cannot hold them back; they must be able to outlast the enemy in battle and win fight after fight for Blambangan when defeat seems likely."
 expel_muslim_insurgents: "Expel the Muslim Insurgents"
 expel_muslim_insurgents_desc: "With the rise of Islam in the west on Sumatra and in the Malay Peninsula, Java seems to be the only bastion of Hinduism left in the main chain of islands. The states to our west are seeking to convert our people and snuff out the lasting legacy of Hinduism in Blambangan, but we shall not let them! We must ensure that our administration is strictly Hindu in most if not all aspects. If this means empowering the Brahmins to help us in this effort, then it is a price we must pay."
 centralize_trading_authority: "Centralizing Trade"
 centralize_trading_authority_desc: "Trade in Java has routinely been decentralized thanks to the internal nature of the island itself. By looking toward new methods of land cultivation and building inland roads as well as renewed infrasture, we can make sure trade is much more centralized and efficient through Blambangan."
 restore_javanese_peace: "Restoration of Java"
 restore_javanese_peace_desc: "For decades now, Java has not known peace. The wars of religion between Hindus and Muslims has caused a great amount of strife alongside conflicts with foreigners from far off shores. In time, when we restore Java to its original state with Hinduism being the prime religion of the land, the prosperity garnered here will be echoed throughout the ages in one unified tone."

 unify_south_kalimantan_desc: "We hail from the area known as South Kalimantan. Though Hindu kingdoms have come before us in the area, we are the first Islamic state in the area and with this status we must be ready to unify the island like never before. Where previous states in our area were troubled by internal struggles, we will learn from their mistakes and proclaim a stronger and more centralized state."
 ties_to_java: "Ties to Java"
 ties_to_java_desc: "Part of our population hail directly from Java and Javanese culture has permiated throughout the various communities of Banjar for decades now. We would be wise to capitalize on our partial Javanese heritage and do as they do: build up a strong and robust naval force that is capable of securing our coastal land. In time, this will help cement Banjar as a true force to be feared on this island and the many others in the Nusantara."
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara: "Migratory Ties"
 migratory_ties_around_nusantara_desc: "The Banjar people are not bound to just Banjar Sultanate alone, not at all. Migration occurs and Banjar merchants travel abroad to various communities where they sometimes settle down in, spreading our influence in foreign lands. By using these various pockets of Banjar people in diplomatic matters, we can better proclaim our right to lands outside of Borneo itself."
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people: "Equals with the Dayak People"
 cooperate_with_the_dayak_people_desc: "The Dayak people are the indigenous people of South Kalimantan and though they are not Muslims like the majority of Banjar people are, the Dayaks are equal to our own. We must learn to respect and cooperate with them since they make up a good portion of our core population; doing so can help us learn to control internal matters to a greater degree in the future."
 repel_the_javanese: "Repel Coastal Invasions"
 repel_the_javanese_desc: "It is from the coast that we will find many invasions coming for us. Banjar has several lucrative trade ports that people from Java, Sumatra, and Makassar value, so defending them through refined strategies inland in conjunction with well-built ships will be crucial to our survival."
 trade_with_makassar: "Trade with Makassar"
 trade_with_makassar_desc: "Makassar is the closest island to Borneo and has been a great trade partner of Banjar for ages now. We trade in not only foods and spices, but also in cultural aspects as well, meaning that the populations of both islands are ready to cooperate with each other when necessary."
 securing_bornean_tributaries: "Secure Tributary States"
 securing_bornean_tributaries_desc: "Banjar's starting position had several tributary states in place with Banjarmasin being the central point in which authority was held. Though we are more centralized than our past, we still need a steady stream of tributary states to exert our influence outward toward different lands and islands. The number of internal tributaries paying orderly tribute will serve as an example to foreigners who wish to be apart of our system."

 consolidate_the_southwest_desc: "The hilly and tropical terrain of Southwest China has historically been hard to control because of the various tribes and clans that live here.

 reinforce_supply_routes: "Reinforce Supply Routes"
 reinforce_supply_routes_desc: "What our home region has taught us is that supply routes are absolutely crucial to fielding any sort of military force. Proper depots, ammunition storage, food reserves, everything that encompasses 'logistics' needs to be taken care of to the greatest possible degree in Zhou for future campaigns."
 suppress_tribal_sentiment: "Suppress Tribal Sentiment"
 suppress_tribal_sentiment_desc: "The tribes and clans of the southwest, though pacified to a degree, are not always happy with our administration or they have disputes of there own that boil over into great bouts of conflict inside our own territory.

Being one of the contenders here, we shall proclaim ourselves as the true successors to Pasai and use Islam to gain the upper hand in the land. Unification will not come easily and we will need an effective army to battle our foes in every direction."
 strait_combat: "Strait Combat"
 strait_combat_desc: "The Strait of Malacca is where a great amount of trade flows through, meaning that there is a great amount of profit to be made if one is to control the entire thing.

 wider_muslim_world_support: "Support from Western Muslims"
 wider_muslim_world_support_desc: "With new technology and faster communication via faster ships, we are coming into contact with Muslims from Arabia and Persia at an increasing rate. Many people travel to Aceh and from Aceh to explore the worlds of east and west, meaning that both sides are attracting a great amount of traders and scholars. By cultivating this positive maritime trade of ideas and people, Aceh will become a true entrepot for Sumatra and more."

 successor_to_pasai_desc: "As we grow in strength and prosperity, it is becoming greatly evident that we are the only true successor to the Pasai Sultanate. Through fires of war and the blood spilled in feuds, Aceh's sultans and viziers are promoting what the Pasai Sultanate strived for. Let us not let our ancestors down, and let us march forth into the future with glory and honor."
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra: "Islamic Bastion of Sumatra"
 islamic_bastion_of_sumatra_desc: "Much like how the Pasai Sultanate was a bastion of Islam for Sumatra, we are as well. Unlike those of Pasai though, we can take to spreading Islam due to having the foundations of the faith firmly established. Along with this, Islamic scholars from the west can surely help us out in this endeavor as well."

 the_looming_hostage_crisis_desc: "What we have been doing when we conquer territory is that, we take a portion of the people from the cities back to our own territory as hostages, using them as we please for labor or other matters. This can and will lead to increased strife within Aceh since these people will become so numerous that they will eventually want to revolt. We must put a stop to this practice now and institute new practices when we conquer land; we would rather not set ourselves up for disaster in the decades to come."

 fighting_through_the_jungle: "Fighting through the Tropics"
 fighting_through_the_jungle_desc: "The tropical nature of Sulawesi means military movements are tough for all troops involved. Having no knowledge of the terrain can easily lead to disaster, but Luwu is the exact opposite in this regard.

 buginese_cooperation_with_natives: "Learning to Cooperate"
 buginese_cooperation_with_natives_desc: "Our core people, the Buginese people, are actually migrants to Sulawesi. The island chain is the home of the Buginese people now, but the indigenous people need to be treated with respect and care if Luwu is to be stable and prosperous. Whatever path we take in the future, we will be in harmony with our people groups, whether they come from Sulawesi itself or from outside of our core islands."
 gunpowder_rise: "Gunpowder Influx"
 gunpowder_rise_desc: "With gunpowder weapons being more readily available throughout Nusantara as the decades have gone by, we of Sulawesi cannot afford to be stagnant in our ways. There are states that would threaten us from all directions and indeed they use gunpowder to a degree that we would not be able to stand up to them if they invaded us. Modernization efforts need to be put in place for all of our military troops and sailors, no matter the cost."

Populations are increasing rapidly and we cannot maintain tribal ties that undermine the Luwu administration. Structuring society over time to fit a more rigid model that does away with most if not all tribal ties can help Luwu prosper and make it a much more powerful trader throughout Nusantara."

Though their time has long since passed by and the Javanese are off doing their own thing, Makassar has taken in the influence of Majapahit to a degree and benefited because of it.

 ship_building_sector_desc: "With how Buton is situated, it is in a very suitable location for building ships of various sizes, that is if we have the harbors and docks to actually build them in. By promoting the construction of coastal structures and learning how to build them more efficiently, we can speed up our rate of ship production greatly."
 enforce_political_cohesion: "Enforce Political Cohesion"
 enforce_political_cohesion_desc: "When worse comes to worse in Buton, our navy working with our army will be what secures us political power legitimacy. Dissent in the islands and across Sulawesi will not be tolerated; force will be used if necessary to bring stability and cohesion to Buton and its territories."

 KBU_ideas_bonus: "Kaabu Ambition"
 malian_legacy: "Mali's Legacy"
 malian_legacy_desc: "We were on the fringes of the Mali Empire at its height though we did feel the effects of the political and military organization that Mali spread outward. We of Kaabu being a claimant of Mali's legacy should not discard these foundational elements that the Mali Empire left behind. Instead, we will build upon it and create a lasting empire that is a true successor to the once mighty 'Manden Kurufaba'."
 warrior_elites_of_kansala: "Warrior Elites of Kansala"
 warrior_elites_of_kansala_desc: "The heart of our people is at Kansala and it is there that a great many warriors gather regularly not only to serve Kaabu but also to refine their tactics through field training. Granted we have to make sure this training does not turn into a bloody competition between the highest ranking warriors, Kansala's warrior elites do serve to embed a militaristic marking on all of Kaabu."
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans: "The Koring and Nyancho Clans"
 the_koring_and_nyancho_clans_desc: "The two head clans of Kaabu are that of the Koring and the Nyancho and they are both very militaristic in nature. They make their money and reputation off of warfare that involves Kaabu and as such help manage most of the Kaabu military. Though the degree of effective military management can vary at times, the military councils they hold and the way in which they take to logistical matters is nothing short of impressive for all of West Africa."
 malian_cavalry_legacy: "Malian Military Organization"
 malian_cavalry_legacy_desc: "Capitalizing more on how Mali organized its military, cavalry tactics is something that we should naturally focus on since the cavalry culture from the Mali Empire still permeates throughout Kaabu. Using various weapons on horseback and building our strategies around what our cavalry can do is what will aid us best in the future."
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers: "Roots as an Outpost"
 fortify_kaabu_frontiers_desc: "Originally, Kansala and the area that is core to Kaabu was just a military outpost established by the Mali Empire. Over the decades though, it has evolved into a center of culture and military might that must be defended at any cost. Since Kaabu's inception, we have relied more on offense over defense, but seeing as Kansala is becoming more and more central to our administration and military, and our trade depots are increasingly valued by a number of different groups, we need to properly fortify what we currently hold with walls and garrisons."
 importation_of_musket_weaponry: "Importing Gunpowder Weapons"
 importation_of_musket_weaponry_desc: "With trade along our coast increasing as time goes on, the weapons we are getting from trade are becoming more and more useful as time goes on. Though traditional weapons are doing us well, gunpowder weapons are making a large impact on Kaabu's military potential, especially when dealing with less organized tribes inside and outside our domain. Integrating these new weapons fully into our military will undoubtedly bring us victory after victory in the ages to come."
 stop_the_muslim_advances: "The Wars of Religion"
 stop_the_muslim_advances_desc: "Religious wars are something that we do not practice regularly, but those outside of us, especially those who follow Islam and Christianity with the utmost strictness, they practice these wars of religion quite regularly. If they want to bring this strange practice to the mighty armies of Kaabu, then they will be beaten in their own game."

 violent_migrations: "Violent Migrations"
 violent_migrations_desc: "Our start was in the days of migration across West Africa, and in these days of migration we fought against settled states for every piece of land we could get. The Mali Empire tried to stop us before, but with their destruction and the rise of the Fulo state, few will avoid giving in to our demands for land and concessions."
 cavalry_of_the_fulo: "Cavalry of the Fulani"
 cavalry_of_the_fulo_desc: "To supplement our migrations from the past and to aid our military today, cavalry have been integral to the very nature of the Fulani people. Their useful nature as civilian animals for farmers and such is great, but using them for skirmishing and full on charges against enemy armies in times of war is what we will truly need them for."
 clashes_over_gold: "Clashes over Gold"
 clashes_over_gold_desc: "The valuable gold mines that the Mali Empire are what helped made it prosper like no other empire had in West Africa's history. Seizing them as the Mali Empire decays away will line the pockets of Fulani nobles and royals to the point where they, collectively, can field an army like no other in all of West Africa."
 war_over_falling_states: "Warring State Chaos"
 war_over_falling_states_desc: "The lack of a large empire in West Africa that can hold power over several areas means that warring states are common. The decaying influence of the Mali Empire has given rise to the state of West Africa that the Fulani have come upon, but they are not going to be swallowed up by the chaos surrounding them. The Fulani will tame the chaos floating about and rein them into a suitable empire."
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo: "Increasing Muslim Influences"
 muslim_influence_over_the_fulo_desc: "Mali's rulers were Muslim indeed and so are the rulers of eastern states in West Africa, but what of the Fulani leaders? That will be answered at a later date, but none can deny that Muslim influence is increasing over the entire Fulani population. The Muslim influx brings with it more manpower for our military, but it will also bring questions that our administration must answer in time."
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe: "The Torodbe"
 the_influence_of_the_torodbe_desc: "They have risen from all parts of those who live in the Western Sudanese region and have been gaining slow influence all throughout the Sahel. The Fulo state is not immune to their influential teachings and several nobles are keen on listening to the words of the Torodbe leaders; they seek to eliminate the remnants of our traditional religion and even encourage jihad against others, but still not every single part of Fulo is on board with them. We cannot expel the Torodbe from our lands it seems, but maybe we can use them for good as times goes on?"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs: "Strike down Regional Chiefs"
 cut_down_regional_chiefs_desc: "In order to keep order within the wider Fulo state, we will need to deal with tribal ties that are heavily ingrained with local communities. These regional chiefs and leaders who hold sway amongst various communities far away from our capital area need to be reined in either through diplomatic means or military force and judging from our fiery past, the latter will be of no issue for us."

 descended_from_bayajidda: "Descendants of Bayajidda"
 descended_from_bayajidda_desc: "Founder of the Hausa states, Bayajidda was, according to legend, a prince from Baghdad that was exiled after the city was conquered by Queen Zidam. He went west and south with a large group of warriors and eventually arrived in Borno and from here the legend begins to diverge a little depending on where one is situated. Regardless of this divergence though, all Hausa states know that they are descendants of Bayajidda and are the legitimate Hausa Bakwai."
 chiefs_of_indigo: "Chiefs of Indigo"
 chiefs_of_indigo_desc: "We of Kano and Rano are known as the 'Chiefs of Indigo'. Cotten grows in plentiful amounts in our home areas and as such, we produce a great amount of cloth and dyed clothing for other cities and states around us. Continuing this tradition into the future will ensure a prosperous and colorful future for all of Kano."
 grand_centers_of_trade: "Hausa Centers of Trade"
 grand_centers_of_trade_desc: "The Hausa states are divided along political lines at times, but one thing that they all have in common (besides heritage) is the fact that they make for great traders and merchants. Hausa trade hubs are valued by many people groups like the Kanuri, the Nupe, the Yoruba, and even the Songhai. Who is to say we can't keep this tradition going into the future?"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts: "Support Foreign Unrest"
 supporters_of_foreign_revolts_desc: "On our borders, there are a number of people groups who are not content with their overlord's authority. We are working on our own situation in regards to this, but seeing as there is opportunity in supporting foreign unrest so that the borders and influence of Kano might expand, we should welcome these possibilities in the years to come."
 manage_animist_islamic_relations: "Managing Religious Relations"
 manage_animist_islamic_relations_desc: "Islam and traditional animist beliefs of the Hausa people are intermingling constantly but there is not a true consensus as to what the religion of the Hausa people should be. In an effort to appease both sides, we should attempt to tolerate both sides here and make a state that can thrive off of multiple religions interacting with each other in peace."
 center_of_muslim_scholarship: "Center of Muslim Scholarship"
 center_of_muslim_scholarship_desc: "Kano leans toward the Islamic side of matters when it comes to religion and indeed our capital city has become a center of Muslim scholarship as of late. Promoting the trade of ideas that these scholars bring through is something that Kano would greatly benefit from."
 tributary_empire_legacy: "A True Tributary Empire"
 tributary_empire_legacy_desc: "The states of the Hausa people and indeed those that surround them are fit for paying tribute to us instead of being outright conquered and forced into submission. By setting up a formal code of laws and tributary restrictions and rights for this entire matter, the Hausa people can benefit greatly."

 chiefs_of_the_caravans: "Chiefs of the Markets"
 chiefs_of_the_caravans_desc:  "The location of Katsina and Daura allows the easy control of incoming caravans for all of the Hausa people and cities. Increasing the hold over these trade routes and formalizing the system in which they trade in will make Katsina and Daura all the more prosperous, lining the pockets of Hausa nobles and merchants alike."
 expand_the_gidan_korau: "Expand the Royal Palace"
 expand_the_gidan_korau_desc: "The royal palace is named 'Gidan Korau' or, House of Korau, and it is perhaps the oldest palace in all of the lands of the Hausa people. With its prestige and wonder being well known throughout the region, we should take to expanding the palace and modernizing it as time goes on so that we can handle any administrative task that comes our way."
 hausa_style_walls: "Walls of the Hausa"
 hausa_style_walls_desc: "To help shield ourselves from incoming raids and invasions, our people and military have constructed rudimentary walls around our capital city which has caught the eye of Katsina engineers. If we can work with them and engineer stronger and more stalwart defenses with Hausa-style architecture, there will be few who can threaten the likes of any Hausa-controlled city, or, at least any Katsina-controlled city."

 chiefs_of_slaves_desc: "The power we wield amongst the traditional Hausa kingdoms is that of being the slave keeper, supplying labor to the various cities of the Hausa people. Our place in the grand scheme of things is crucial to the way of life in our region and the Hausa people depend on the practice of slavery for now, and so long as they do, Zazzau will continue to provide and be the distributor of human labor."
 ambitious_zazzau: "Thirst for Conquest"
 ambitious_zazzau_desc: "The fire that burns within the heart of Zazzau is not that of hatred for others per say, but rather the fire yearns for a prosperous and unified Hausa people with the seat of governance in Zazzau itself. For far too long we have waged war with our fellow Hausa cities to no avail; there must be a person and a city to break the stalemate once and for all! If Zazzau must be that righteous giver of firey justice so that the Hausa may be united, then so it shall be."
 slow_spread_of_islam: "Islam in Zazzau"
 slow_spread_of_islam_desc: "The more we spread our influence, the more we see Islam making its way into the ranks of Zazzau's nobility, merchant class, and peasantry. Though we are not set on adopting every single principle of Islam from the very start, we are interested in what ideas it can bring to us. Perhaps we can make a more tolerant Zazzau with the influx of these Muslims?"

 GOB_ideas_bonus: "Gobir Ambition"
 chiefs_of_protection: "Chief of Protection"
 chiefs_of_protection_desc: "Our duty to the Hausa people and to our kin to the east has always been protecting the western corridor from threats. Malian and Songhai conquests have consistently knocked at the door of the Hausa people to no end, leading to bloody skirmishes that cause great strife throughout our homeland. We must never forget our task as the defenders of the Hausa people; we must always keep our military prowess a cut above the rest and keep our men in the best fighting shape possible."
 mali_and_songhai_threats: "Threats to the West"
 mali_and_songhai_threats_desc: "The border between our land and the fearsome powers to our west is often blurred and inconsistent. Whilst this makes for easy land claims for the people of Gobir, it also means that our enemies are on the same level as us in regards to how easy it is to take land. Let us meet them on the open fields of war and fight them to the very end, for Gobir fears no tribe, kingdom, or empire."
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa: "Control the Hausa Kingdoms"
 assert_military_authority_for_hausa_desc: "It is unfortunate that we cannot leave our fellow Hausa cities and states as friendly independent entities near us, for they are always in a position to be invaded from elsewhere and succumb to external threats. In order to help secure the lands of the Hausa, we must make them subservient to Gobir and ensure that they are safely within our domain."

 migrants_from_mali: "Migrants from Mali's Collapse"
 migrants_from_mali_desc: "Our foundations are somewhat murky and unclear, but what foundation we can know firmly is that many of our people hail from the old Mali Empire. Though not as powerful as it once was and crumbling to outside influence and internal decay, those migrants from Mali have made their home in the lands of Kong and helped it prosper ever since."
 coming_from_different_war_houses: "From Different War Houses"
 coming_from_different_war_houses_desc: "The founding people of Kong were not from one single dynasty or one single clan or war house, but rather they were from several different war houses. Their names have changed over the decades but what remains the same throughout time is the contribution to the military potential within Kong itself. Their fearsome and powerful legacy is something we strive to uphold."
 indifference_to_kong_religion: "Money over Religion"
 indifference_to_kong_religion_desc: "When people ask the leaders of Kong, 'What religion do your slaves and workers follow?', they will answer, 'It does not matter. As long as they serve us well, they may worship as they please.'. This mentality has been key in our rise to prominence and will continue to do so since we place more emphasis on money and fighting tactics as opposed to the zealous conversion of our own people."
 establish_mercantile_houses: "Establishing Mercantile Houses"
 establish_mercantile_houses_desc: "Whilst the war houses of Kong are plentiful and sometimes a bit hard to control, the increasing flow of trade through our lands means that there should be some system setup so that we can profit in a more systematic manner. Establishing mercantile houses and setting up formal places for merchants to flock to will increase our viability as a trade partner."
 money_buys_armies: "Buying the Troops Needed"
 money_buys_armies_desc: "With trade flowing throughout Kong and money flowing in at a greater rate, we can focus on procuring fine warriors from surrounding tribes and states. Mercenary contracts can help fill in the empty ranks within the Kong armies and we have plenty of money to keep them happy."
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies: "Expansive Merchant Armies"
 expanding_kong_merchant_armies_desc: "The staying power of mercenaries in Kong armies and the lucrative trade that we profit from has come to make us somewhat reliant on steady mercenary contracts. Though we certainly have our own warriors to rely on, the mercenary contracts for Kong are becoming increasingly regulated and easy to come by."
 formal_royal_houses: "Formal Royal Houses"
 formal_royal_houses_desc: "Kong's power is firm on the outside to many, but inside it is still somewhat fragile. War houses and mercantile houses are still coming into conflict with each other at times and with each new feud, our power degrades slightly. Let us try to resolve these disputes from the top-down and institute new succession laws with distinct and formal royal houses that all of Kong recognizes."

 historical_trade_center_desc: "For several decades now, Timbuktu has been a trade center unlike any other in the Sahel Region. From the north come traders from the lands of Morocco and from the west, south, and east come traders from the many plains and river systems of West Africa. Keeping Timbuktu as it is and cultivating its greatest parts can only bring more wealth and grandeur to the city and the people who live in it."
 center_for_muslim_scholars: "Center for Muslim Scholars"
 center_for_muslim_scholars_desc: "From our dusty foundation to now, Muslim scholars have flocked to Timbuktu not only because it is a city of wealth, but also because it was once part of the great Mali Empire. Though now resigned to the texts of history, Malian influence on Timbuktu helped us greatly and the gifts Muslim scholars bring to us is always appreciated."
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu: "The Three Madrasas"
 the_three_madrasas_of_timbuktu_desc: "The Sankore, Djinguereber, and Sidi Yaha Madrasas are the three most important centers of learning inside of Timbuktu. Though centered around Islamic education, these three lucrative and grand centers of knowledge have and will continue to help propel Timbuktu into prominence both through divulging new ideas for us to take up and by attracting foreign scholars in time."
 commercial_endeavors_for_us: "Commercial Endeavors"
 commercial_endeavors_for_us_desc: "Whilst our natural progression in terms of commercial wealth is great, we could do better by ensuring that our own merchants are well protected by guards and also educated to a fair degree. The central administration of Timbuktu would be wise to perhaps fund a school of sorts dedicated entirely to training and perfecting the art of being a merchant."
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger: "Develop the Gift of the Niger"
 develop_the_gift_of_the_niger_desc: "A nickname for our great city has been the 'gift of the Niger', eluding to the fact that we are one of the largest and wealthiest cities along the Niger River. We could use the wealth we gain from our grand capital to develop infrastructure in surrounding areas, especially along the Niger River, and perhaps make a second Timbuktu somewhere along the lines."
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade: "The Sahara Trade Routes"
 secure_the_trans_sahara_trade_desc: "Mastering the trade routes across the Sahara is not easy, but those close to it can learn how they flow and where they regularly come through to. As Timbuktu has always been a natural stopping point for some Saharan trade routes for centuries at this point, it is only natural that we become masters of them."
 tuareg_connections: "Tuareg Connections"
 tuareg_connections_desc: "The versatile and sometimes hostile Tuareg people of the Sahara and Sahel Region swear fealty to no state for long. They are akin to mercenaries that can strike fear into the hearts of many in Timbuktu, but we can also negotiate with them for their services in protecting our trade caravans and such. It is better to be in good standing with these fearsome people than to be their consistent enemy."

 long_range_trading_desc: "We of Bonoman get caravans from states all across the savannah and even the Sahel Region. Lucrative is the trade we indulge in and profit lines all the pockets of our merchants and leaders. Few can resist the temptation of coming to Bonoman markets, and fewer still will leave empty-handed."
 nucleus_at_markets: "Markets are our Heart"
 nucleus_at_markets_desc: "Bonoman cities and towns are not traditionally centered around a palace or military fortress, but rather they are centered around markets where people do business and make money. Whilst strange to other people, it has served us well so far and kept us afloat financially whereas other people suffer when centered around palaces or fortifications, leaving markets to grow much more slowly."
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity: "More Iron Smelting"
 increase_iron_smelting_capacity_desc: "Though we do smelt iron ore into iron for other states and people groups around us, there are others who compete with us in this regard. We need to ensure that Bonoman states are competitive with how much iron they produce and how good the iron is in quality, for if we can outdo our neighbors in this regard, we will secure positive trade relations as well as even more wealth."
 the_akan_gold_trade: "The Akan Gold Trade"
 the_akan_gold_trade_desc: "The lucrative Akan Gold Trade is valued by many around the Bonoman states and we are an integral part of it. The once great Mali Empire even invaded our lands to claim hegemony over the Akan Gold Trade, but their influence did not last long since we asserted our own independence not long after they came through. From now into the future, let the Akan Gold Trade bring wealth and stability to those of the Bonoman states!"
 taxing_trade_routes: "Taxes from Trade"
 taxing_trade_routes_desc: "The many trade routes that come through our land are valuable in many senses, so why not formalize the taxes we impose upon them? They shouldn't be too high so that they drive away business, but they also shouldn't be too low so that the Bonoman states start suffering financially."
 bonoman_blacksmithing: "Bonoman Blacksmithing"
 bonoman_blacksmithing_desc: "Whilst our blacksmiths are used to providing arms to people groups outside of the general vicinity of the Bonoman states, perhaps we can start producing weapons more for our own people. Arming them and training them in a particular style unique to us 'Abron' people could give us a distinct advantage in the future."
 unify_the_bonoman_states: "Unify the Bonoman States"
 unify_the_bonoman_states_desc: "For far too long the Abron people have been split into decentralized states that collectively constituted the 'Bonoman nation'. Introducing a series of centralizing reforms and taking in foreign ideas that are brought to us through trade routes could have a positive effect, and it could help unify the divided states into a solid and cohesive state for the Abron people."

They symbolize not only our people's journey throughout time but also their creativity in keeping the memories of the past preserved for future generations."
 the_king_of_strength: "The King of Strength"
 the_king_of_strength_desc: "Our king is known as the 'Ya Naa', or, 'King of Strength', which stems from the foundation of the Dagbon state itself by Sitogu. The king demonstrates not only his own strength at several times but also in his willingness to defend the Dagomba people in person and with the collective power of the Dagomba warriors."

 govern_over_the_indigenous_people_desc: "The people we have come to govern in our foundational days (like the  Konkomba, Nafeba, Basare, and the Chamba) are still around, though in a reduced set of numbers. We have come to terms with them and the Dagomba people are getting along with the indigenous groups, making for a more cohesive and productive central state."

 implement_the_surviving_tengdamba_desc: "The tengdamba/tengdana were earth priests who owned the land before the Dagomba people came through and conquered the indigenous people. They resisted us as one might expect and many tengdamba were killed along the way, but the remaining ones have proven to be loyal enough to us that they are being implemented as loyal local administrators and military officers."
 invest_in_islamic_matters: "Islamic Investing?"
 invest_in_islamic_matters_desc: "Islam is continuing to be a factor in our politics and societal structure, but we are still skeptical as to what to do about it on a large-scale. Investing in the syncretism between our own traditions and Islam is perhaps the best path here since the traditions of Dagbon are deeply entrenched within our people."
 centralized_political_structuring: "Centralize our Politics"
 centralized_political_structuring_desc: "Decentralized politics is keeping the Dagbomba people from making serious strides in reformation of administrative matters as well as societal traditions. Continuously we are seeing new ideas spread around us, but we are constantly being challenged by old notions of how to do things that hinder us. We need a concentrated effort to break down barriers and reform parts of the Dagbon state so that new ideas are more readily taken in by us."
 expand_at_others_expense: "Policy of Expansion"
 expand_at_others_expense_desc: "The areas around the Dagomba people's homeland are not truly safe and peaceful; there are rivals on all sides, both in the shadows and in the open sunlight.

We both trade in similar materials and we both have prospered because of our position near rivers. It would be wise of us to build upon this importance and develop beneficial trade relations with all of our neighbors if we are able to."
 great_mosque_of_djenne: "Great Mosque of Djenné"
 great_mosque_of_djenne_desc: "Built somewhere between 1200 and 1300 as our tradition tells us, the mosque has slowly become a center of Islamic scholarship and a beacon for traders all around us. Such a symbol of piety is rarely seen in our region and Djenné is truly blessed to have such a great building in our lands. Let us go forth and engage in the great dialogue that happens between Muslims across various regions, for all of them will be welcome in our great mosque."

 salt_gold_slave_trade_desc: "Capitalizing on the trade that our friends in Timbuktu capitalize on can bring us prosperity, right? If we work hand-in-hand with them and cooperate to entice merchants from all over the region to come to our lands, there will be few who can compete with our trade endeavors."
 island_of_djenne: "The Island of Djenné"
 island_of_djenne_desc: "Every year, the Bani and Niger rivers rise begin their seasonal flooding. From July to December, Djenne becomes something of an island and the irrigation of crops around the land becomes possible once more. We rely on this annual flood to help bring us a bit of wealth, but perhaps we can invest more into agricultural techniques that can allow for more to be grown, or different and more valuable crops to be planted."
 adapt_to_changing_trade: "Adapting to Evolving Trade"
 adapt_to_changing_trade_desc: "With coastal trade from the south and west coming into view, we need to be sure that our importance does not decline. Coastal trade is much easier for people to engage in than trade across plains and savannah so we must be ready for when we get a decrease in merchant numbers. By adapting our merchants and our own way of thinking about trade to this evolution in trade in West Africa, we can still have a fighting chance in the world of trade."
 refined_adobe_architecture: "Refine our Adobe Architecture"
 refined_adobe_architecture_desc: "Many around us know Djenné for its adobe architecture. The use of mud bricks is well known throughout West Africa and it is a common building material in drier, more arid climates (such as in Djenné) since it is relatively easy to make in large numbers and quite durable in dry conditions. By refining how adobe architecture is done in Djenné, we can reinforce our buildings so that they are stronger and also streamline the process of making mud bricks in general."
 build_upon_our_wealth: "Djenné's Wealth"
 build_upon_our_wealth_desc: "Prosperity is garnered from knowledge combined with ambition and tempered by commerce, or, at least that is what some of the wealthy merchants in Djenné say. We know that it is true to a degree and we are working to invest the profit we gain from trade and taxation so that our future prospects are much brighter. New trade depots, marvelous yet functional buildings, and prestigious mosques will all be in order for Djenné in time."

 a_crimson_laden_culture_desc: "We are very distinct from our neighbors in a number of ways, but perhaps the most blatant way we are different is through the distinctly red colored clothing we wear and our red wall paintings and murals. Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"

 diarchical_administration_desc: "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly: the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."

 adorn_the_dead_desc: "The dead of Ichma must not be sent off with nothing but dirt and rocks at their side, no, that would be degrading their worth! They must their valuables and jewels buried with them, at least partly, so that their journey to the afterlife is not a dark and burdensome one. In this way, we honor our recently deceased men and women and bring peace to their body at least in this realm. We only hope that in the next realm, they are as well off as they were here."

 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion_desc: "How can we contact the divine? How can we properly ascertain their messages and send messages back to them? It is certainly not out in the open with harsh conditions beating down at us whilst we are the midst of the gods, so the pyramids of our ancestors can do just fine. It will not be only those pyramids though, for we can build more as time goes on in other places where the Ichma people settle down into."
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old: "The Pieces of the Wari Empire"
 unite_the_confederacies_of_old_desc: "The breakup of the Wari Empire was long ago, but we remember rightly that the Ichma people came about in the ashes of the burning state. Not only us, but many others got their start when the Wari Empire began to burn, leading to several confederacies of people forming afterwards. Some may still be around and some may have been conquered, but we of Ichma must do what we can to reunite the old lands of the Wari Empire."
 huaca_of_the_ichma: "Huaca of the Ichma"
 huaca_of_the_ichma_desc: "A huaca is something of a monument, sometimes natural and sometimes man-made, that is revered by not only our people but also by other people around us. Some huaca are known to have rituals of veneration and devotion dedicated to them whilst others are along pilgrimage routes for our various gods. The more huaca we can get under our control, the more unified and satiated our people will be."

 successor_to_the_wari_people_desc: "The memories of the old Wari Empire fade away as time goes on; their old cities and artificats are not going to be around forever, but what they put forth can still be a foundation to build upon. Let us renew the efforts of the Wari people of old and pick up where they left off, triumphing over disasters that come our way and military foes who seek to dismantle our power."

 tholing_tabo_and_khochar_monasteries_desc: "Yeshe-Ö, the second king after our founding, was perhaps the greatest leader from our past. Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."
 old_city_of_tsaparang: "The City of Tsaparang"
 old_city_of_tsaparang_desc: "Though it was not always our capital, Tsaparang has become a haven for the rulers of Guge. It has slowly been built up over time due partially to the fact that successful claimants in civil wars centering around Tsaparang instead of Tholing, meaning that today Tsaparang is something that inspires both faith in the ruler of Guge and trust in their governance."
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival: "The Revivers of Tibetan Buddhism"
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival_desc: "There is one key title that we of Guge hold: the revivers of Tibetan Buddhism. The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."
 strive_for_religious_education: "Religious Education"
 strive_for_religious_education_desc: "Though education is seen as necessary to progress in life by many, few in Guge are able to actually become literate and fully capable of being productive in life despite being fully fledged Buddhists. Let us work to change this as time goes on and promote the building of not only monasteries in our lands, but also libraries and schools that focus on Buddhist texts and also other subjects such as mathematics and geography."
 ready_to_reform_the_faith: "Another Revival?"
 ready_to_reform_the_faith_desc: "The way Buddhism currently is in Tibetan land is not going to stay the same forever since, over the coming decades, we will gain new people and followers who bring new perspectives on old texts, mantras, and traditions that we already know so well. What then do we do and say to these new insights? We welcome them, of course! We will bring them into the wider inter-faith dialogue and be ready to reform our understanding of canonical texts, but it will take time for this to happen."
 converse_with_indian_buddhists: "Conferences and Conversations"
 converse_with_indian_buddhists_desc: "We are not going to be closed off to the other branches of Buddhism that are spread throughout the various lands around Tibet. The traditions of the Indian people, the traditions of the Chinese, the traditions of the Burmese and Thai, they can all contribute to the wider dialogue and conversation we of Guge wish to have, but we simply need more people ready and willing to travel these long distances. Perhaps setting up a formal diplomatic sector is in order?"
 cultural_blending_in_guge: "All Under the Guidance of Guge"
 cultural_blending_in_guge_desc: "Guge has proven itself to be a guiding pillar of Buddhism before when all was thought to be lost in Tibetan lands; when Buddhism seemed to be fragmented to the point of no return. With the resurgance of the grand faith thanks to our hard work and reforms, we can now work on assimilating the various people who are coming into the fold of Guge so that they too can come toward the path of enlightenment. We cannot and will not deny anybody this right in Guge."

 utilize_religious_sects_desc: "There are a variety of small and large schools of Buddhism throughout Tibet and all are useful for various purposes, but when push comes to shove in politics, we will pull all the strings we can to enlist the help of these various Buddhist schools. We are not averse to fighting like some smaller polities are, for we have been in the midst of fighting for decades now! Fighting to secure our place in Tibet and fighting to have our words become law!"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch: "Uphold the Karma Kagyu School"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch_desc: "We are not patrons of the Gelug school of Vajrayana Buddhism which some find strange. Instead, we support the Karma Kagyu school which is quite different in a number of ways when compared to the Gelug school. Its traditional hierarchs, the Karmapa and Shamarpa, should be great friends of our dynasty instead of having to quarrel with other religious schools; they will know our good will and will be one of the strategic pillars of our rise to power."
 sort_through_muddy_marriages: "Profit from Bad Marriages"
 sort_through_muddy_marriages_desc: "Marriages can be a... Tough negotiation for some, to put it nicely, and this is very widely pronounced in the royal families of Tibet since a failing marriage or two in a royal family can lead to widespread discontent in places far away from the royal palace. We were ones to capitalize on marriage conflicts in the previous royal family of Tibet, the Phagmodrupa, and we will continue to profit from future bad marriages around us whilst make sure our own marriages are safe and without issue."

 at_the_heart_of_turmoil_desc: "There is no shortage of warfare in the heartlands of Tibet. Local lords wanting autonomy, Nepali states struggling against Hindu and Islamic states to the south, Muslim khans to the north threatening our survival, nothing is ever easy up here! If continued war is required to survive in our own land than we will take up arms without hesitation!"
 keep_the_sects_loyal: "Keeping the Sects Loyal"
 keep_the_sects_loyal_desc: "The Rinpungpa dynasty must not lose the favor of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism nor the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism that have sent aid in the past. We should be enforcing more secular authority over these sects when possible, or if this is not possible, then at least be informed about the moves these sects are making so that we can effectively counter them politically or religiously when the time comes."
 put_pretenders_to_rest: "Confront Pretenders"
 put_pretenders_to_rest_desc: "Some still see us as pretenders to the throne and think that the Phagmodrupa dynasty should be empowered once again, but we simply cannot let this happen. The Rinpungpa dynasty is in a much better place than the Phagmodrupa dynasty ever was, and if there are any pretenders who wish to install this old dynasty back on the throne, we will gladly meet them in battle or silence them before they can even raise a war banner."
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans: "Refuse Local Lords"
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans_desc: "The loyalty of local lords is always questionable in Tibet, is it not? Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Rinpungpa dynasty. Autonomous lords and authorities that answered to previous people we conquered will be granted no quarter; they will be replaced."

 gongchen_monastery_desc: "Founded by the Thangtong Gyalpo, also known as the Iron Bridge Maker, the Gonchen Monastery is perhaps one of the most revered places in all of Kham next to the royal palace itself. The monastery has stripes of white, dark red, and gray colors that are unique to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and itt is through this monastery that we will project our legitimacy and devotion to all the people of Kham."
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Material Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The great Thangtong Gyalpo graced many with his presence and works, including us who administrate Kham. He built our revered Gonchen Monastery and also was an adept architect, blacksmith, and civil engineer, making his impact known in the various lands of Tibet and Bhutan. Not only this, but he also considered the patron saint of theatre in our lands and he is known as 'the madman of the empty land'. Truly his impact on our land and history is unparalleled."
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Spiritual Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The works of Thangtong Gyalpo were not only in the physical realm though! His work extended far into the realm of Tibetan Buddhism since he is associated with the Shangpa Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sakya schools. Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."
 uphold_dege: "Upholding Dege"
 uphold_dege_desc: "Dege, as our capital city, should be upheld in the highest regard next to the various monasteries and sacred sites we possess. It should be built up to not only project our prominence, but also to attract foreign scholars and religious folk who also wish to come toward the path of Buddhism. As Kham continues to grow outward, so too will our capital city."
 uphold_tibetan_literature: "Tibetan Literature"
 uphold_tibetan_literature_desc: "Literature in Tibetan lands can be somewhat scarce and lacking due to a variety of reasons, but as time goes on, the potential for this to change is becoming more and more abundant to us. By putting through reforms to start paper production and to educate the minds of younger and younger people, we can begin to cultivate a strong literary culture throughout Kham."
 formalize_derge_districts: "Formalize the Districts"
 formalize_derge_districts_desc: "City organization in Tibet hasn't been the highest priority to many leaders both local and royal, but routinely we are seeing the need to plan our cities out more and more as time goes on. Starting with Dege, we should work to plan out our new districts in various cities with engineers and workers alike so that buildings are as functional as possible and also robust in their construction."
 chinese_contacts: "Chinese Contacts"
 chinese_contacts_desc: "To our east is the Sichuan Basin, a great trading hub for Tibetans and Chinese people alike. Chengdu may be ethnically Chinese, but we are thankful that it has blossomed into a grand city of trade and production since the path from Chengdu to Dege is fairly clear to many. Contacts with our eastern neighbors will only continue to serve us well later on as trade grows ever more plentiful."

 after_the_yuan_dynasty_desc: "After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty to our east, the authority in Tibet that the Mongols once had waned heavily and we were one of the bastions of Tibetan strength. Our dynasty created an autonomous Tibetan state and formally threw off the shackles of Mongol authority and it is because of this that many still flock to our banners."
 regents_for_the_old_kings: "Regents to the Old Kings"
 regents_for_the_old_kings_desc: "Our early rulers did not strive for earthly titles that gave meaningless honor, for they knew that they were regents for the old kings of Tibet. The glory of those olden days may not be coming back any time soon, but we can still strive to be humble like our first set of rulers and live as they did, for the Tibetan people and by Tibetan laws."
 fortified_city_governance: "Dzong Governance"
 fortified_city_governance_desc: "To help organize our political situation, forming a solid basis for authority beneath us was crucial in our upbringing. The creation of dzongs (fortified cities meant for local governance) helped cement our authority on the local level and did a great amount of work in projecting our power throughout Tibet when we were much larger in size."
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land: "Staunchly Tibetan Laws"
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land_desc: "No longer are we ruled by Mongolian laws, but rather by Tibetan laws! Those foreign edicts and measures put on our people in the past were undoubtedly burdensome, but now since we've been independent, we have been able to implement laws meant for our own people. No longer will we bear the weight of the old Mongol authorities."
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside: "Neutral Relations are Good Relations"
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside_desc: "When the Ming Dynasty rose up in the place of the Yuan Dynasty, it was clear that they did not think much of us in Tibet. These fairly neutral relations were and still are beneficial to us, since we can thrive whilst being left alone and not pressured diplomatically from various sides."
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty: "Three Parts to the Dynasty"
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty_desc: "The Phagmodrupa dynasty is divided up into three parts: the ruling 'desi', the spiritual masters (chen-nga), and the preserver of the family (dunggyu dsinpa). This helps ensure not only the piety of our lineage, but also the continuation of far into the future... But, it can also lead to a number of internal feuds if we are not careful."

 the_fire_of_feuds_desc: "Failed marriages and corruption are not strangers to the Phagmodrupa dynasty, not since the Rinpungpa dynasty has risen up and taken advantage of our vulnerable position in the past. We need to learn how to sort out our internal conflicts in the future so that we can prevent future disturbances and revolts, and most of all, we will exact revenge upon the Rinpungpa dynasty."

Some of these old road networks and paths we can still use, and Cajamarca's foundation will be built off of moving quickly thanks to these old paths between villages and towns."
 beacon_of_culture: "Beacon of Culture"
 beacon_of_culture_desc: "Cajamarca is perhaps the most complex and grand political state that emerged after the collapse of the Wari Empire. Though we are not on the level of the Wari Empire in terms of size or strength, we still have some of the finest pottery and works of art in all of the mountainous land. Surely over time we will attract the likes of various scholars and religious people alike who will serve in Cajamarca."

 experiences_from_civil_wars_desc: "In our past, civil conflict was something that we could not avoid. Even today, civil war looms on the horizon and threatens our people with devasation if politics in Cajamarca decline horribly. But, there is one thing that these wretched conflicts breed in our soldiers: experience. How to prepare for battle and get supply lines ready, these are things they'll never forget thanks to our previous eras of internal strife."

 from_oral_tradition_to_written_desc: "Oral tradition is a great thing for Cajamarca and indeed many of the surrounding people groups we interact with, but oral history is something we cannot rely on forever. We should begin a new effort to formally begin making a writing system for our people so that the oral history of our ancestors may never be truly lost, even when our current elders pass away."
 start_roads_of_cajamarca: "Start Building Roads"
 start_roads_of_cajamarca_desc: "Old Wari paths are just the perfect places for future road networks. The innovations in road making done by those in Cusco are spreading quickly and we of Cajamarca would be wise to adopt them, utilizing their fine designs for ourselves and having our military officers trained in exactly how the should operate."
 fighting_the_quito: "Quito Conflicts"
 fighting_the_quito_desc: "The northern area where the Quito people live is a place of consistent conflict. Though some chiefs and rulers have made peace with us before, more often than not our interests are in conflict with each other. In order to fully subjugate the Quito people and perhaps any others who would wish to go against our interests, we will need a larger standing military."

 the_cuismancu_state_desc: "The consistent fighting and bloodshed in the mountains is only hardening Cajamarca and its people from all walks of life. We are learning how to govern more effectively, utilize diplomacy to our advantage, and also how to enforce higher military standards as time goes on.

It is a faded memory, but one that is distinct and unique to us as Yellow Uyghurs or, Yugurs as sometimes we are called. This period was prosperous for us indeed, but also a time of intense warfare between us and various other people since we occupied a very valuable position. It is this tradition of warfare that we still remember to this day."

 our_trade_is_warfare_desc: "Even when we held the position as a mighty kingdom, war was still part of our life, year by year and decade by decade. After our destruction and period of subjugation by the Tanguts and later by the Western Xia and then the Mongols, we remember just how integral war has been for us. Conquest is the only path for us in the future, and there will be no satiating this ambition within the Yugur people."

 the_influences_of_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism has come into the lands of the Uyghurs due to being so close to Tibet and the Chinese people, though the latter practice Confucianism along with Buddhism. We are not opposed to Buddhism and its influences since its teaching can often go hand-in-hand with the traditions of Tengri. Perhaps in time we can even learn to become somewhat tolerant of foreign faiths that don't line up with with the traditions of Tengri, but that is for later."
 learn_from_tangut_dominance: "Tales of the Tangut Period"
 learn_from_tangut_dominance_desc: "The destruction of our old kingdom led into a period where we were dominated by the Tanguts. It was a dark time where we were forced from a place of grace into a place of relative uncertainty and subjugation. It is something we will never forget and something we will fight to never let happen to us again."
 the_western_xia_war: "The Western Xia War"
 the_western_xia_war_desc: "In the times of our old kingdom, the Western Xia made war against us and inflicted costly casualties to our people and helped weaken us for more foreign foes later on. Learning from this costly war has led to our best commanders and officers thinking that we should be investing in a larger and more structure military instead of trying to focus on pure diplomacy to prevent such a destructive war in the future."

 the_carnage_of_oirat_ming_wars_desc: "Between the fighting that goes on between the Oirat Horde and the Ming Dynasty, we are stuck almost in the middle of it all wondering who will come out on top. If we are ambitious enough, we can capitalize on the destruction of the losing side and make valuable gains for all of Kara Del, but we will have to be strategic about when and where we strike. The traditions of our ancestors in the steppe necessitate that conquest be key to our survival, and this is the perfect playground for us to do as such."
 descendants_of_the_chagatai: "Descendants of the Chagatai Khanate"
 descendants_of_the_chagatai_desc: "Our origins lie in the thoughts and actions of a Chagatai prince in the past and to some, it is a menial origin story that has little meaning. To us though, it grants us valuable connections dynastically to the Chagatai Khanate that came after the split of the old Mongol Empire. Maintaining our dyanstic presence will ensure loyalty and legitimacy in the people we will over."
 playing_the_role_of_subject: "The Benefits of Subjugation"
 playing_the_role_of_subject_desc: "We have been subjects of larger powers in the past since Kara Del has historically been a weak power. This has its consequences of paying tribute and such, but we have benefited via taking into account the better technology and organization that our overlords had. Taking advantage of the advances our neighbors have and implementing reforms in their style, well, why wouldn't we continue to do it?" 
 to_what_deity_do_we_praise: "Islam? Buddhism? Tengri?"
 to_what_deity_do_we_praise_desc: "We find ourselves at the confluence of several faiths: Tengri and its traditions, Islam and its five pillars, and Buddhism and its schools of thought. It is not easy choosing one religion over the other as Kara Del has populations of all three in its land, but we can at least try to make do in tolerating all three whenever possible. Promoting a stance of tolerance will undoubtedly lend to a greater amount of people flocking to our stable banner."
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat: "Contracts in the Steppe"
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat_desc: "Our connections to the Chagatai Khanate lends us connections all around the steppe which is good since there are a variety of mercenary forces that will be more in favor of working for an influential descendant of the Chagatai. Hiring these largely cavalry-based armies will cost us, but we know that they will be worth it later on since they can act as a good buffer for our own forces."
 emphasis_on_cavalry: "Embrace our Heritage"
 emphasis_on_cavalry_desc: "Though our connections with the Ming Dynasty are somewhat firm, we cannot discard our traditions nor our connections to the steppe. Cavalry armies are something that we know inside and out, and focusing on reforming how they work in battle is going to be one of our main focuses in the future.

 the_cacan_language_desc: "Our language is not as formalized as other languages nearby but it is prominent in the lands of the Calchaqui people; it is our distinguishing feature that helps identify us uniquely in the crowd of states in the Andes Mountains. The more we formalize it though, the more useful it will become and the more standardized it can be from place to place in our own lands, thus granting easier communication to all people in our domain."
 northern_influences_in_calchaqui: "Influences from the North"
 northern_influences_in_calchaqui_desc: "To our north are other states that quarrel in the mountains due to various feuds and conflicts, but we do not seek to get involved with those petty situations. We are seeing more and more people come south due to those struggles, however, and as a result we are becoming slowly influences by our northern neighbors. Perhaps we can utilize this influence in a positive way? Preparing ourselves for any incoming war that might come to us due to border tensions and such."

 mutual_friendship_between_cacan_groups_desc: "There are some groups of Cacan speaking people that don't really know who to pledge fealty to or to what state they should go to. Though we speak the same language, they don't feel as closely connected to us unfortunately due to the years we have spent trying to consolidate our own power and maintain stability. If we can reach out to these groups and befriend them over time, we can slowly integrate them into the Calchaqui confederation as it stands."
 reprisals_against_invaders: "Reprisals Against Invaders"
 reprisals_against_invaders_desc: "As we slowly unite the various Cacan speaking groups of people around us, we must instill in them a staunch defensive mentality against those who would invade our lands. There are some who think the lands of the Calchaqui can be just pillaged and settled by other populations, but we will bring to them a stalwart defense that will grind down their will to fight. The Cacan speaking people will not be taken out so easily."
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation: "A True Confederation"
 cultivate_a_proper_confederation_desc: "Centralizing authority in our lands is something we struggle with since people are so spread out and our work at formalizing our language is still going on, but making loyal that contribute to the Calchaqui cause nicely is much easier to do. Perhaps a federated state is not our true path, but instead a more confederated state is what will make us truly great."

 construct_calchaqui_fortifications_desc: "To help with our defensive stance, we shall erect strong stone fortifications with multiple layers inside that can withstand enemy assaults and siege tactics. We are not going to simply put up stone slabs we find out in nature though, we are going to cut them and shape them into effective shapes and work toward making them an effective barrier that can hold back the advances of our enemy."

Their culture and tradtiions might very well be alien to us, but we are not beyond learning to accept them into our fold; our shyris and those around him know the value of accepting these people as they are."

 quitu_cara_cultural_power_desc: "Quito is not a political entity with a single 'Quito' culture that extends back for many centuries. Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."

They hold connections to places far beyond our current reach, meaning we could greatly benefit from promoting trade with them over time. Even when we integrate them inside of our borders, maintaining healthy relationships with the tribal people will be key to keeping the economy of Quito running smoothly."
 integrate_the_others_into_quito: "Integrate Other Cultures"
 integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc: "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own. It is these joined hands and through bonds of kinship built up over many ages that Quito will maintain its power both politically and militarily."
 celebrate_our_lives: "Celebrate Life"
 celebrate_our_lives_desc: "Though we may give our people a grand way of being sent off into the next life, we must also take time to celebrate our own life as it is, right? Feasts filled with joy and praise to the gods above, games being played by children and adults, instruments being played by our own family members, and good times being had by all within our communities. These are the times we should relish and adore, not just the times of victory via conquest or the success of a good harvest."

 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings: "The Fulani Jihad!"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings_desc: "For far too long there have been kafirs and infidels taking power against Islamic emirs and sheiks, but no more! Massina will be one of the many spearheads of the jihad started by Fulani people and there will be Islamic justice for all those who used their power to stifle Islam's spread! To arms, brothers and sisters, to arms!"
 madrasas_of_massina: "Islamic Learning of Massina"
 madrasas_of_massina_desc: "Though Massina is new to the land it sits upon, Islam is not new and as such certain ideas about Islam are already spread heavily in certain cities of ours. Let us help promote Islam's spread by building up madrasas throughout the land so that not only can ideas be propagated over time, but also things such as literacy and mathematics can be utilized by a wider portion of the populace."
 strict_islamic_interpretation: "The Strictness of Islam"
 strict_islamic_interpretation_desc: "There can be no room for a loose interpretation of Islam in Massina; there must be exact wording in our laws and strict adherence to what is outlined throughout the Quran and the Hadiths. Through our interpretation of Islam we will have a tighter grip on power and few will be able to question our authority without also raising questions about their own piety."
 regulated_use_niger_river_land: "Regulate Land Usage"
 regulated_use_niger_river_land_desc: "As part of our laws we firmly regulate the usage of land along the Niger River. This has resulted in a great rise in productive potential since people can use the land in a proper and organized manner instead of roaming about without clear boundaries. In time, we will see our profits increase when trade along the Niger River comes through to Massina."
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi: "The Guards of Hamdullahi"
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi_desc: "Hamdullahi is a significant city in Massina as it holds a great deal of cultural history to us. The guards of Hamdullahi, though undoubtedly changed at this point since their inception, still stand as a monument to our past and should be remembered for their stalwart attitude in defending Hamdullahi against invading forces. If we can instill this defensive mentality in more people, our defensive capabilities will be much better."
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development: "Strengthen Land Development"
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development_desc: "Through our laws on land development, more and more people are coming to our cities and communities to settle down and begin a new life of agriculture instead of living a pastoral and nomadic life. This has granted us advantages over time and allowed us to start developing our urban centers even further than before which we will certainly need to do as times continue to change around Massina."
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue: "The Seeds of Religious Dialogue"
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue_desc: "And as our urban centers grow, we will be attracting new religious scholars and preachers who interpret Islamic doctrine differently than we do. Instead of turning them away and persecuting all those who think differently from us, we can perhaps have some religious dialogue over time and open up specific centers of religious study so that we can refine our own interpretation of Islam alongside others."

 patrol_the_niger_river: "Patrol the Niger River"
 patrol_the_niger_river_desc: "The blood of an empire can be trade revenue, and for the Bamana state, trade along the Niger River is proving to be almost like blood for us. We must always be striving to make sure it is safe and secure so that not only can we profit from trade canoes going along its flowing streams, but so that we can profit from producing valuable crops alongside the banks of the river itself."
 subjugate_rival_chiefs: "Subjugate Internal Pretenders"
 subjugate_rival_chiefs_desc: "The pretenders to our throne and the ones who would see our power broken up are always on the lookout for weak spots in our state. We must have an active and capable military force that is ready to cut down insurgents whenever and wherever they rise up and, if it is even possible, before they rise up."
 the_komo_council: "The Komo Council"
 the_komo_council_desc: "The administration of Bamana is traditional in many ways. Our ancestors are revered all across our land throughout our court system and the komo, a body of advisors dedicated solely to theological matters, helps us conduct our worship to our ancestors correctly. Let us hope and pray for a better future that all of Bamana can partake in."
 the_slave_war_cycle: "The Slave-War Cycle"
 the_slave_war_cycle_desc: "Slaves and wars are consistent throughout West Africa and we are no different in relying on the continual slave-war cycle. Part of our economy and military rely on the capturing and trading around of slaves so it is only right that we become adept at manipulating this cycle to our advantage. The more calculated our war efforts are and if we can deal with slaves on a consistent basis, we'll see the populace become used to this cycle as well as the state itself."
 build_up_segu_cities: "Build up Bamana Cities"
 build_up_segu_cities_desc: "Our cities grow more and more as we continue to move on in the world, but how should we go about improving them over time? City planning is, after all, a key feature of a well-defined state and we of course are striving to be just that. Perhaps investing in Bamana architecture and engineering and promoting slave work for these endeavors would help bring a semblance of city planning to our land."
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors: "To Our Ancestors"
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors_desc: "The sculptures and altars we fashion for our long gone ancestors are finely made and well thought out. They have meaning in almost every detail and our administration rightly places a great emphasis on them being part of the centrality of our state since they represent such significant figures of our past. Promoting the fine crafting of these works of art and faithfulness should be something we always strive to do."
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods: "Improve Building Methods"
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods_desc: "The methods of building we obtained from the Songhai are more for building defensive structures and they have served us well so far. Continuing to develop these methods of constructing walls, garrisons, and defensive structures from the materials we have around us will help improve our defensive positions and provide more security to our people."

 YAO_ideas_bonus: "Yao Ambition"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan: "Fusion of Two Clans"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan_desc: "The inception of Yao came as a result of our nomadic ancestors coming into prolonged contact with Kanem Bornu's people. After this, a slow fusion of two clans happened, this being between the Kayi Clan and Ngizimis Kanembu Clan, and the result was the political entity of Yao. Tracing our heritage back to this pivotal period is what our people look up to time and time again, and we will always trace our lineage to back to that period."
 rivalry_versus_kanem: "The Lake Chad Rivalry"
 rivalry_versus_kanem_desc: "Lake Chad is fertile ground for food and growing states, but it is also fertile ground for conflict between Kanem Bornu and ourselves, the Sultanate of Yao. We've had ages of conflict before and we will continue to in the future if we neither of us win this prolonged state of hostility that has lasted for generations."
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks: "Facing Death Again"
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks_desc: "Though we once had the upper hand against Kanem Bornu in the late 1300s, those 5 leaders we killed in Kanem Bornu did not break down the power of our enemy completely. They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation. That moment in time taught our people that facing death in a war is something that will be frequent for Yao, and we will still fight with all we got no matter how close to death we are."
 caravans_toward_egypt: "Caravans Toward Egypt"
 caravans_toward_egypt_desc: "Because of our position in the eastern part of Lake Chat and toward the treacherous desert, and also because of our nomadic heritage from before we settled down, we have trade contacts throughout the eastern land and even toward the Nile River. The more trade we promote eastward toward the Nile River and ultimately toward Egypt, the better off we will be in terms of revenue."
 lake_chads_importance: "The Centrality of the Lake"
 lake_chads_importance_desc: "The lake by which we base our power around is significant to many people. The fertility it provides for crops and the fact that it is also a freshwater lake means that it can support a great amount of people and a great state surrounding it. The more finely we cultivate the land here, the more we will have in store for later on."
 nomadic_warfare_ways: "The Ways of the Nomads"
 nomadic_warfare_ways_desc: "Fighting as nomadic people is something few can master, especially when the fighting is along sand dunes and sparse savannah. Though we aren't nomads anymore, the leaders of Yao are versed in nomadic warfare and moving quickly around the field of war so that the enemy has little chance of catching a friendly army out in the open."
 season_of_bilala_conquest: "Season of Conquest"
 season_of_bilala_conquest_desc: "Once our conquest of around the lake is complete and the old traditions of the Kanem Bornu state are incorporated into the Sultanate of Yao, we will begin carving a new path for ourselves and the people around Lake Chad; we will be feared by others, instead of being subjugated by rival empires and kingdoms. There is no time to rest now, not when its the season of conquest for the Bilala people!"

 citadel_of_kokand: "The Citadel of Kokand"
 citadel_of_kokand_desc: "Kokand itself has been our starting point and the place from which we project power from. Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."
 tajik_mercenary_fighters: "Tajik Mercenaries"
 tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc: "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus: "In and Around the Oxus River"
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus_desc: "The Oxus River has been stage for a number of states that came before us and it has seen countless conquests from a variety of people. We are going to continue this tradition and conquer land just like our ancestors have, leaving fire and blood behind us as our people march forth, banner in one hand and musket in the other."
 the_khojas_of_kashgar: "The Kashgar Khojas"
 the_khojas_of_kashgar_desc: "Khojas (meaning 'master' in Persian) are people who are descedants of the Naqshabandi Sufi teacher named Amad Kasani (1461-1542). At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."
 preventing_civil_wars: "Prevent Collapses"
 preventing_civil_wars_desc: "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."
 unify_the_uzbek_people: "Uzbek Unity"
 unify_the_uzbek_people_desc: "Our kin that lie around the Aral Sea and west of the Tarim Basin, the Uzbek people, are rather disunited and longing for leadership that can tame their various clans. Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."
 a_settled_khanate: "Changing Times, Changing People"
 a_settled_khanate_desc: "We cannot deny that our traditions of khans and steppe riders are becoming outdated more and more. To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."

 times_of_rare_unification: "Rarely Unified"
 times_of_rare_unification_desc: "It seems like we are scattered and disunited throughout the ages and surrounding people groups take advantage of us whenever they can, but is there any hope of claiming unity amongst the Nupe people? Glimmers of light have shown this in the past, but still we remember the fighting and feuds that always brought down these hopes. Let us never forget the times of warfare before we were unified into our current state."
 etsu_nupe: "Etsu Nupe"
 etsu_nupe_desc: "The Etsu Nupe, or, King of the Nupe, is a title that has been claimed before and is claimed now, sure, but there must be solid backing behind it. We are consistently working on building up our base of power in terms of military potential, but at the same time we are working to solve age-old disputes our leader and his lineage may have with other Nupe clans and tribes."
 traditional_customs_with_islam: "To Share in Faith"
 traditional_customs_with_islam_desc: "We share many religious customs with several people groups around us, but this new faith called 'Islam' is increasingly coming forth to Nupe communities and their preachers seem intent on converting us. Whilst we will resist full conversion of this suspicious new religion, some of our friends and allies have taken up Islam and been completely fine with it; perhaps we could see what this faith has to offer us."
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede: "The Legacy of Tsoede"
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede_desc: "If there is one figure in Nupe history that we look up to, it is Tsoede, the great unifier of Nupe people. Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."
 assimilate_the_border_people: "Taking in the Border People"
 assimilate_the_border_people_desc: "There are a variety of people on our border as the border itself is not concrete; it is porous and can be freely passed through at times by a variety of people. Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits. Perhaps bringing our traditions and culture to them will help cement their fealty and loyalty to us and bring them closer to being true Nupe people."
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship: "The Power of Kin"
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship_desc: "Bringing together two different sides through the act of marriage is at times a great way to ease tensions and we of Nupe are keen on making sure these marriages go smoothly. Whether they are internal families who have feuds with us or foreign families who are potential allies, securing valuable marriages with a variety of people will spread the influence of the Nupe far and wide."
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest: "Clashes against Islam"
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest_desc: "Islam may have its good parts and may be somewhat present in Nupe lands, but there are political entities that take Islam to the worst degree possible and wage war against us in the name of it. We will not stand by and watch our fields burn and men die in vain, no, we will rally against these unjust wars and fight back with all that we can."

 former_kings_of_italy_desc: "The title 'King of Italy' has been a contested one for a long time, and one that has not had any serious political implications beyond the Holy Roman Empire for more than a century now. Yet our legacy lives on from when we were able to contest for this very title in the late 800s and even obtaining it for a short while with Lambert I and Lambert II of Spoleto. Though this historical light behind us is faint, we will use it as much as we possibly can to stake claims on the land around us, conquering what is rightfully belonging to those of Spoleto."
 papal_connections_and_alliances: "Friends in High Places"
 papal_connections_and_alliances_desc: "Because of the placement of Spoleto, the Papal States is and always has been a natural ally against rival states to the north and south. Cardinals and governors have done regular visits to Spoleto and make for good connections both in public and in private so that, in the future, we can better carry out any plans we have in regards to diplomacy."
 the_gift_of_spoleto: "The Gift of Spoleto"
 the_gift_of_spoleto_desc: "What do you want this Christmas season? Is it a new train set? A nice sweater? Well how about control over Spoleto as a Christmas gift? Indeed this was somewhat the case of the centuries from about the 900s to the 1000s as Spoleto was repeatedly 'gifted' to either the Papacy or other significant political players. Though we're not going to sell ourselves out like this, being so highly valued in the past and right now has its perks."
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy: "Italian Crossings"
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy_desc: "Spoleto itself is situated in a rather 'non-fertile' part of the Italian Peninsula and as such has had to contend with crossing hills for many years now. It builds up leg muscles in the short-term and helps build up effective means of navigating rough terrain in the long-term, the latter of which we are going to need for our troop movements in the future." 
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto: "Unshaken Religious Convictions"
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto_desc: "Given where Spoleto is politically and how tumultuous the religious landscape in Europe is, it would be quite the piece of news to hear that Spoleto was uprooted from its ancestral faith. It is clear that the road ahead for us must truly be that of the Catholic Church as our loyalty to the church has been unshaken for many centuries, but if our faith truly does change for something else, it must mean that new faith has a truly monumental truth or truths, no?"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy: "Loan Our Sword; Lend Your Sword"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy_desc: "Like many other states in the Italian Peninsula, we of Spoleto are well versed in the notion of mercenaries. We loan out our troops to others for a fine bit of coinage, they lend us their swords in exchange for a few bags of coin, it's all a regular thing here. The more we deal in this area of warfare, the more Spoleto will benefit from it later on."
 learn_from_the_papacy: "Teachings of the Holy See"
 learn_from_the_papacy_desc: "We should not just simply let the Papal States be a nice ally or a static rival of ours in the Italian Peninsula, especially since we have plenty of history with the Papal States via being under direct papal rule with a proper cardinal as governor. If we can uphold what we've learned from our years of being a papal fiefdom, then we will be able to make others bend to our will in similar ways that the Papacy does."

 an_old_catholic_see_desc: "Since centuries ago, after the Wendish Crusade, our small bit of land has been home to the Ruppiner See. Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names. If we can project its claims out further, we'll be sure to have an easier time expanding without repurcussions."
 redo_our_town_walls: "New Town Walls"
 redo_our_town_walls_desc: "As old as our town is (alongside Neuruppin), the town walls erected around our central place of authority are not what they used to be. We should work on rebuilding them and constructing new defensive structures with high quality materials so that our defensive garrisons have a better chance at surviving incoming sieges."
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation: "Hefty Religious Consequences"
 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness: "Between the Elbe and Oder River"
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc: "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently. Clearing some forests out of the way and harnessing some irrigation for our farms in a more efficient manner would do wonders for the productivity of Ruppin as a whole."
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims: "A Place of Claims"
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims_desc: "Being part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg for as long as we have, and also seeing how many conflicts have erupted between Brandenburg and its neighbors like Saxony, Ruppiner officials know that the land we stand on it a land of claims and of strategic value. Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."
 local_minded_officials: "Knowing our People"
 local_minded_officials_desc: "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet: "The Folks of Ruppin"
 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet_desc: "We are not thought of as a militaristic place at all, but rather as a place of rural localities and small-time merchants and officials. Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 welf_pieces: "Welf Dynastic Pieces"
 welf_pieces_desc: "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg: "The Vogtei of Calenberg"
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg_desc: "Traditionally, the title of 'advocatus' ('vogt' and 'vogtei' in Old High German) was given to those who were legally delegated to carry out some secular responsibilities of a feudal lord or insitution. This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle: "Expand Calenberg Castle"
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle_desc: "Built by Otto the Strict in 1292, Calenberg Castle has served as our place of central authority for decades upon decades now. Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from. If we renovate it and fortify it thoroughly over time, few will be able to break through its walls and threaten our power."
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald: "Oberwald and Unterwald Development"
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc: "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."
 religious_issues_brought_home: "And it Followed me Home..."
 religious_issues_brought_home_desc: "We didn't ask for the Protestant Reformation to disturb our towns and citizens, but it followed our clergy and devote people home... Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg: "The Defense of Calenberg's Towns"
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg_desc: "The various petty wars that are waged all across the Holy Roman Empire are usually nothing to note of by bigger powers like Saxony or Austria, but to Calenberg, these wars pose as threats and learning opportunities. If we can learn to fortify our towns effectively and train more local militia groups to fight back against incoming invaders, fewer and fewer enemies will dare encroach on our land for fear of what resistance they will face on the local level."
 contest_for_northern_power: "A Worthy Contestant"
 contest_for_northern_power_desc: "The lands to the north in the Holy Roman Empire are rife with surges and drops in power from various electors, princes, and bishoprics. Calenberg is part of this cycle and is proving to many in the north that it is capable of fending for itself and even becoming a true stronghold. Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

 military_elite_amidst_greeks_desc: "The Principality of Achaea was not greek in its founding at all, but rather it was state set up by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin in 1205 during the Fourth Crusade. Because of this foundation and how the entire principality was structured, it was clear to all from the outset that Achaea would be a French military elite ruling over a mostly Greek populace. This comes with its risks and rewards though, ranging from potential hostilities from the Greek people themselves to knowing just how to deal with rebellious people when they rise up."
 secular_baronies_of_achaea: "The 12 Baronies of Achaea"
 secular_baronies_of_achaea_desc: "Shortly after our founding, William of Champlitte (the first Prince of Achaea) sought to flesh out a proper administration over the land. He did this in 1208-1209 when he created a commission chaired by himself and also composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets, and five Greek magnates. This commission assessed the land and divided it up as best they could but perhaps the most stand-out aspect of this commission's work was the creation 12 secular baronies. Though we have had to adjust these baronies as time has gone on and perhaps the number fluctuates up or down as we see fit, they allow for a more efficient way of taxing our citizens."
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies: "The Prince's Relation to the Baronies"
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies_desc: "In Achaea, we do not see the prince as being ruling with absolute authority like some other states do, but rather the prince is the 'first among equals' when it comes to his relation to the baronies of Achaea. In this respect, the baronies of our land can construct castles and hand out capital punishment as they see fit whilst also serving the prince in the field and garrison for portions of the year. Alongside this, women could inherit fiefs inside of Achaea due to the laws not being entirely based upon Salic Law, thus offering a slightly wider array of people available to our court."
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict: "Violent Clashes between East and West"
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict_desc: "Founded in the midst of the Fourth Crusade and seeing our own demise in the fires of dynastic conflict and the struggles of the Byzantines, we of Achaea know exactly what fighting between eastern people and western people is like. Achaea itself has had to adapt to these prospects over the decades through constructing new castles, allying certain states, or purely learning to fight with more heart and more discipline. It is this last aspect that we must cultivate most of all though since we are in such a precarious position, for if we cannot rely on proper defenses or worthy allies, we must defend the land with our bodies and weapons alone."
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania: "The Great Court; Assizes of Romania"
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania_desc: "All secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council known as the 'Grand Court', which was and still is headed by the prince. It has a large amount of authority in Achaea and its decisions are binding not only to the people below the prince, but also to the prince himself. On top of this Grand Court, the Assizes of Romania were produced between the 1200s and 1400s whilst our principality was still alive and well despite dynastic claims hampering things. The Assizes of Romania helped blend Byzantine laws with French law and has helped Achaea and other Greek polities achieve a modicum stability with regards to laws of the land."
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin: "Emulate William II Villehardouin"
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin_desc: "Perhaps the greatest prince Achaea ever had, William II (reigned: 1246 - 1278) was French in descent by highly cultured in regards to almost every aspect about him. Not only was he a prince who desired land and rightfully obtained it through the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnese, he was a poet and a troubadour who achieved a flourishing literary culture within the court of Achaea itself. Though he became embroiled in the politics of the Byzantines and the other small states around in the 1200s, his legacy lives on within us and it is our duty to carry on his legacy of both a vibrant court and a grand vision of conquest combined with literacy."
 dynastic_claims_everywhere: "The Mess of Dynastic Claims"
 dynastic_claims_everywhere_desc: "The fall of the Principality of Achaea in the early part of the 1400s was the result of dynastic claims tearing away at our insides and also the then strong Despotate of Morea taking advantage of the turmoil occurring. We may have been fated to die a sorrowful death back then, but we are much stronger now compared to back then and we can capitalize on these dynastic feuds in this current age as opposed to how futile we were when various dynasties from across Europe sought out our land through inheritance or conquest."

 the_constitution_of_padua_desc: "Starting the in early 1000s, political movements around Padua made it necessary that our city establish for itself a constitution and a proper administrative body for governance purposes. Though some like Venice and the Papal States do not care for our constitution, it is perhaps the foundational pillar by which we have held to for centuries now, and it is a pillar that we will continue to build off of well into the future."
 memories_of_the_league: "Lombard League Memories"
 memories_of_the_league_desc: "The days of the Lombard League are long gone seemingly, but its memories are very much still alive in Padua to this day. The intrusion of the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the refusal to fully submit by cities from Northern Italy continues to give Paduan people hope and morale whenever an invade comes through to besiege our settlements."

 learn_from_defeats_due_to_venice_desc: "Our defeats by the Republic of Venice have made things rather difficult in Padua, but things are not as hopeless as they might seem. Our administrative body has learned from the past and knows just how vital a strong standing military can be; encouraging the build up of land forces for the defense of Padua will henceforth be one of our highest priorities."

 build_up_the_university_of_padua_desc: "Founded in 1222 by students and folks from Bologna, our noble university is filled with scholars of all fields of study. But is it enough for Padua? Is the university large enough to house intellectuals from even more fields of study as time goes on? The answer to that is, of course it isn't! Thus, we must be ready to build up the University of Padua with more facilities and areas of study so that we can continue to attract more righteous and forward-thinking scholars."
 insight_into_humanism: "Humanist Ideas Expanded Upon"
 insight_into_humanism_desc: "Many around us in the Italian Peninsula are concerned with theological insights, mercantile prospects, mercenary contracts, or artistic splendor. Padua, however, is concerned more with the notion of humanism combined with Christianity itself; we wish to have a population that is strongly civic minded and that can participate in civic processes that involve their land and matters that affect their own lives. Despite Padua being a small center for this new notion of humanism, we can ensure that it becomes a staple part of scholarly work in the future."

 the_council_and_credenza_of_padua_desc: "Beholden to the Paduan people and those inside our borders, the general council and the credenza (executive body) of Padua are what keep things in line for the most part.

 blessed_by_saint_maurice_desc: "St. Maurice of the Theban Legion in the 3rd Century was a peculiar figure and one who, according to the tales we have been passed down, refused to harm fellow Christians despite the orders from his superiors. It is this stalwart attitude in the face of what we know is wrong that strengthens the faith of those in Coburg, and the martial tradition that St. Maurice inherited from his time in the Theban Legion can be somewhat emulated in Coburg's own soldiers. Fight for faith, and fight for Coburg!"

 develop_the_regality_of_coburg_desc: "If we are to ever be with the highest echelons of royalty throughout Europe, Coburg must be fit to host some fine banquets and ceremonies. Doing this will of course require us to develop the land of Coburg properly and build up infrastructure to get proper building materials, hireable artisans, and competent engineers. Once we've done this, we will be well on our way to becoming a true royal state in Europe."
 the_reformation_in_coburg: "At the Edge of Turmoil"
 the_reformation_in_coburg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation reaches out to every corner of Europe, we of Coburg cannot help but feel its harsh effects on our population. Divided down to the familial level in many cases, the Protestant Reformation is for many nothing but a horrid showing of what religious divides can do to people. But, our administration is finding good lessons in the fires of religious violence as they are realizing just efficient a tolerant and integrated administration can be."
 disconnected_and_reconnected: "Shady Inheritances"
 disconnected_and_reconnected_desc: "As all of the Holy Roman Empire knows, inheritance can be a tricky subject and it can often lead to disconnected and strangely shaped territories. Coburg is no stranger to this and our royalty are keen on seeing that any split up pieces of Coburg are united into the central royal domain. Considering how inheritance laws can be manipulated too in places around us, connecting our various pieces together shouldn't be too hard."
 royalty_preserved_in_style: "Refined Aesthetic Taste"
 royalty_preserved_in_style_desc: "As Coburg grows and becomes stronger internally, the aesthetic taste of our people is becoming more refined as well. Reviving old styles and reinventing them with more modern construction techniques and modern materials will go a long way to helping us achieve the prestige and honor that we desire, and it will also help us obtain the influence we desire with other states around us."

 invest_in_long_term_structures_desc: "And as we pursue our refined taste in artistic structures, we must not forget about the functionality in our many buildings. Whether they are simple houses and manors or places of creation like forges and foundries, these places can all benefit from Coburg's focus on aesthetics and methods of construction. As the years go by, we will see that our engineers and builders will be some of the best that Europe has to offer."

 lippe_feuds_desc: "Are we blessed by these feuds, or cursed by them? There are people who argue for both sides, but the leaders of Lippe hold firm to the latter due to the fact that capitalizing on these feuds and winning them could lead to serious territorial expansion alongside increased influence. This is a long way off though, and for now we must be content with working the fields of battle with our soldiers to enforce the claims of Lippe."
 raise_the_status_of_lippe: "Rising Higher and Higher"
 raise_the_status_of_lippe_desc: "Lippe is not just a singular town as some outsiders might think, but rather it is a collection of towns that form a state that is greater than the normal sum of its parts. Further developing these towns upward through promoting infrastructure like roads, libraries, and markets will help bolster Lippe's economic status greatly."
 what_belongs_to_lippe: "What Belongs to Lippe"
 what_belongs_to_lippe_desc: "The feuds of the past ensure that Lippe will have no shortage of expansion paths; our dynastic claims alongside the various diplomatic webs we are in help make this a reality. Thus, when we annex new territory through war, others around us will know that we are justified in our actions and those of Vienna, Prague, Munich, and other prominent places will have nothing to fear from our expansion."
 fortify_lippe_towns: "Protect our Belongings"
 fortify_lippe_towns_desc: "As we build upward and expand outward, Lippe is going to need stronger garrisons is it not? Strengthening the defensive structures we have and building more castles belonging to our royal dynasty is exactly what will help hold our realm together, especially if armies from Bohemia, Austria, or some other place come marching through to curb our momentum."
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy: "Shifts in the Shadows"
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy_desc: "It is partially thanks to our deals and practices with regards to diplomacy that Lippe is as influential as it is. The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly. To help with this, formalizing our diplomacy with a secure office of sorts in the administration will do just the job."
 adopting_church_ordinance: "The Church Ordinance of Lippe"
 adopting_church_ordinance_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has given birth to a number of issues in Lippe that we otherwise would not have had, yet still we find that we can grow from the fires of this religious fracturing of the Catholic faith. Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."
 relations_with_surrounding_powers: "Tinder for the Fires"
 relations_with_surrounding_powers_desc: "We have been a subject to other states and independent at other times, meaning our connections go far throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Whilst we sustain ourselves on diplomacy and keen administrative practices, we must always be aware of the fact that we have mercenary contracts open to us in the way that others do not. Feuds and shady connections have their advantages, if you can survive to see the end of the former and utilize the latter."

 waning_power_of_the_bishops_desc: "Despite Osnabrück's past, the power of the the bishops has been waning over the course of the 1300s and 1400s. Though the cathedral chapter may have its power on the rise, more secular authorities are seeing to it that the politics and regular administrative matters of Osnabrück are handled by competent folks of educated backgrounds. Perhaps it was the clergy that was holding us back this entire time? We may find out in the future."

 war_profits_in_osnabruck_desc: "Osnabrück's various fueds across state lines are taxing upon the local populace, but for merchants seeking new chances at making a profit, they're actually rather intriguing opportunities. Mercenary contracts offered to us are often helped out by the fact that our merchant class is willing to take these daring attempts at making a profit during times of war, so why shouldn't we use these contracts?"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck: "A Religious Mess"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck_desc: "With the rise of Protestanism and its various offshoots, Osnabrück is a mess with religious communities striving to have ultimate influence over the land. These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to have a solid solution with favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by the administration of Osnabrück."
 religious_orders_called_in: "Call Upon Holy Orders"
 religious_orders_called_in_desc: "From the Jesuits to the Augustinians, Osnabrück has been the place where a variety of these holy orders come to settle down in so that they can cultivate their influence and add to their ranks. Whilst we will refuse their influence in our daily politics, we can at least work with them on recruiting new missionaries that serve both these holy orders and Osnabrück itself."
 theological_insights: "University of Osnabrück"
 theological_insights_desc: "Though the fires of religious reformation have blazed across Osnabrück, one good thing that has risen from the ashes has been the University of Osnabrück. It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work. Cultivating the university to be where new ideas spread around Osnabrück will be what helps our state stay in the realm of innovativness whilst also staying true to our faith."

Turmoil of the past be damned, we have not fallen just yet to foreign annexation and we will strive to be as independent as we possibly can.

 centralize_the_shan_states_desc: "The various states of the Shan people have been quite decentralized throughout their history. The Pagan Kingdom attempted to round up the Shan states into a confederacy of sorts, but it barely held together for more than a few decades before falling apart. If we are to be different this time around, we must work on a central administration that can pass effective laws and be heard to the point of all Shan states answering to the central administration."

Fighting in the jungles and hills is no easy task, but it has trained our soldiers over time to make precise and calculated movements with ease. We'll be sure to use this skill against any state that seeks to stand against our intentions."

We are no different in this sense because we too have interest in the Irrawaddy River and what it provides. It can truly become an agricultural and commercial heart for the Shan people."

The Shan move and work to protect each other from those who seek to smite them down; they will not be divided again."

 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders_desc: "One consistent form of historical documenting that the Shan people have done over the centuries is that of chronicles of former leaders. Granted much of the previous ones have mythical elements embedded within them, the more recent chronicles of Shan rulers are more accurate and true-to-life. Keeping a running history of our rulers into the future will help enshrine legitimacy within the royal family."

 WZL_idea_2_desc: "Iron has already been mined in and around Wetzlar in Celtic times. In the 13th century mining, metallurgy and the iron trade in Wetzlar were flourishing. Pig iron was traded as far as Frankfurt am Main. A statue of Saint Barbara adorns the fountain of the iron market."
 WZL_idea_3: "Numerous Orders of Knights"
 WZL_idea_3_desc: "From the 13th century onwards, several orders of knights settled in Wetzlar, including Franciscans, Dominicans, Carmelites, Cistercians, the Teutonic Knights and Premonstratensian Sisters."
 WZL_idea_4: "Feuds with Solms"
 WZL_idea_4_desc: "Decades of feuding with the Counts of Solms, who tried to make Wetzlar a Solmser city, threatened the vital trade routes. This is why Hermannstein Castle was built in the north of Wetzlar to further protect the town. The emperor also tried to protect the imperial city. Not until 1392 could peace be made with the Counts of Solms."
 WZL_idea_5: "Important Trade Routes"
 WZL_idea_5_desc: "The city was situated with fords through Lahn and Dill at the intersection of two trade routes. One of these was the historically important trade route Hohe Straße from Antwerp over Cologne and the imperial cities Wetzlar and Friedberg to Frankfurt am Main. The Weinstraße led from Mainz through Usingen and Wetzlar, past Marburg to the west, to Hildesheim and on to Bremen and Lübeck."
 WZL_idea_6: "Reformiertes Treppchen"
 WZL_idea_6_desc: "Since 1544 Wetzlar was one of the Protestant imperial estates. The Catholic Marienstift remained intact because it had been agreed to leave the choir room to the Catholic canons and the church nave to the Protestant-Lutheran congregation for church services. Calvinist religious refugees from Wallonia moved to Wetzlar in 1586. The former Franciscan church was assigned to them. The term 'Reformiertes Treppchen' for the lower part of the street called Jäcksburg still bears witness to the presence of the refugees."
 WZL_idea_7: "Hospital zum Heiligen Geist"
 WZL_idea_7_desc: "The Hospital Church is located in the medieval suburb of Wetzlar in the immediate vicinity of the Lahn. In 1755, it was demolished and rebuilt according to the Lutheran model."

 national_assembly: "National Assembly"
 national_assembly_desc: "The abolition of the Estates General has ultimately made way for the formation of the National Assembly, the revolutionary legislative body of France formed by the representatives of the former Third Estate. When the monarchy and other Estates attempted to repress the power of the commons, the National Assembly won the support of the cities and forced the King to acknowledge its power, refusing to submit to military force. This staunch resistance would eventually culminate in the Storming of the Bastille, the flashpoint of the French Revolution."
 committee_of_public_safety: "Committee of Public Safety"
 committee_of_public_safety_desc: "Revolutions are not always peaceful. Constituted after the execution of King Louis XVI in 1793, the Committee of Public Safety was organized to defend the Revolution in France, uniting the reborn state against both domestic and international foes. Using its broad supervisory and administrative powers across the armed forces, judiciary, and legislature, it organized the national response to the First Coalition and the Vendée revolt, unafraid to utilize brutality and oppression to defend the Revolution’s ideals at every turn. Sometimes, terror is an acceptable price for the pursuit of progress."
 french_consulate: "French Consulate"
 french_consulate_desc: "The coup of Brumaire on 10 November 1799 signaled the downfall of the unpopular Executive Directory and the rise of the military dictatorship of Napoleon Bonaparte, who became First Consul of France. Although Napoleon gradually undermined the republican institutions that many of the nation’s revolutionaries had originally strived to defend, Napoleon’s centralization of government and growth of the national economy led to his reign becoming increasingly popular, foreshadowing the rise of the Empire which would become the most dominant European power since the fall of the Romans."
 
 gallican_church: "Gallican Church"
 gallican_church_desc: "It is imperative that the French church maintains some pretense of independence from the prerogatives of Rome. As a result, it is essential that the country’s monarchs claim privileges that the Papacy would otherwise withheld, including the right to appoint bishops who will serve the interests of the nation first. While the Papacy may chafe at our declaration of a Gallican Church, they will have no choice but to at least negotiate with the foremost Christian power."

 highland_harmony: "Highland Harmony"
 highland_harmony_desc: "The Montagnards live in harmony with nature, traditionally practicing a method of agricultural cultivation known as rotational swiddening, in which new fields are cleared, cultivated for several years, and then allowed to lie fallow for ten to twenty years before being brought back into cultivation. It is a sustainable farming system in areas with low population densities."

 communal_living: "Communal Living"
 communal_living_desc: "The world of the Montagnards is centered upon small communities in which kinship is primary and resources are shared by all."
 matrilineal_inheritance: "Matrilineal Inheritance"
 matrilineal_inheritance_desc: "The land of the Montagnards is considered family property and inherited through the female line. Families hold customary rights to their plots whether they are being farmed or fallowed. Ultimately, the strong ties of the Montagnards to their land prevents conflicts within communities over land use."
 bachelors_houses: "Bachelors' Houses"
 bachelors_houses_desc: "Many Montagnard villages have what is called a bachelors’ house, where unmarried young men live and the presence of women is taboo. They serve as not only the ritual center of the village, but also as a site of mobilization for war."
 elephant_domestication: "Elephant Domestication"
 elephant_domestication_desc: "Elephants are a relatively common sight in the highlands, and some of the Montagnard groups, such as the Mnong, are skilled at domesticating them. Naturally, elephants can serve effectively as beasts of burden, but they may also one day be needed for war."
 preserving_a_way_of_life: "Preserving a Way of Life"
 preserving_a_way_of_life_desc: "Since time immemorial, the Montagnards have lived in relative seclusion from outside influences, including those of China and Dai Viêt to the far north, only loosely acknowledging the overlordship of the Cham from the lowlands. However, the outsiders regard us as barbarians and may one day seek to claim our land and uproot our way of life. We must be ready to protect our highland home from any who may threaten to end peace."

 marcher_lord_idea_1: "Clawdd Offa"
 marcher_lord_idea_1_desc: "Offa's Dyke was built by an Anglo-Saxon king of Mercia centuries ago. The earthworks now establish the border between Wales and England - the same border we have bravely ventured out over."
 marcher_lord_idea_2: "Appointed by England"
 marcher_lord_idea_2_desc: "The land conquered from the native Welsh petty kings has been organized into earldoms, with each earl invested by the King of England into a hereditary position. With the backing of the most powerful force in the British Isles, we too can dominate the political landscape of these strange Celtic lands."
 marcher_lord_idea_3: "Sicut Regale Rulers"
 marcher_lord_idea_3_desc: "Compared to normal English fiefs, we have extensive freedoms. Royal writ does not apply in our frontier holdings, and we instead rule sicut regale - \"like a king.\" We can build castles, administer laws, declare wars, establish market towns, maintain chanceries, confiscate lands, hold trials, and appoint our own sheriffs."
 marcher_lord_idea_4: "The Mortimer Legacy"
 marcher_lord_idea_4_desc: "Roger Mortimer was the most powerful of the Marcher Lords, holding exensive allodial titles across Wales and Ireland. He became so powerful that he effectively ruled England in tandem with his mistress Isabella - the wife of King Edward II. Eventually, Edward's son built up enough support to wrest back control of the kingdom from Mortimer, having him executed, but sparing Isabella's life."
 marcher_lord_idea_5: "Foreign Settlers"
 marcher_lord_idea_5_desc: "It was not just the Anglo-Normans who conquered and settled South Wales. Many invested earls were brought directly from France, Brittany, and Flanders. Our lands are thus comprise of a coalition of foreign and domestic populations, each with their unique strengths they provide to the state."
 marcher_lord_idea_6: "Geoffrey of Monmouth"
 marcher_lord_idea_6_desc: "He who controls the past, controls the future. He who controls the present, controls the past. Geoffrey of Monmouth is the greatest of our Cambro-Norman historians, famous for his work on Arthurian legend. Historia Regum Britanniae remains the definitive work on the history of our realm."
 marcher_lord_idea_7: "Council of Wales"
 marcher_lord_idea_7_desc: "Edward IV needed to properly administer Wales even long after his eponymous ancestor's conquests. In 1472 he established the Council of Wales and the Marches, a regional governing body originally headed by important bishops. Wales thus had a degree of internal governance far beyond its integration."

 irish_clan_idea_1: "Custodians of the Clan"
 irish_clan_idea_1_desc: "Even after the English regranted clan-based titles as feudal titles and began to bestow the position of custodian in replacement, the most powerful of the Irish clan leaders were treated as royalty while the others were merely considered chieftains. Consequently, we must maintain strong diplomatic ties to ensure our position amongst the clans."
 irish_clan_idea_2: "Ancient High Kings"
 irish_clan_idea_2_desc: "The position of High King of Ireland was given to one of the leaders of a large clan each time the previous King died. This position existed since Sláine Mac Dela around 2,000 BC and is an integral part of our cultural heritage."

 irish_clan_idea_5_desc: "Our conflicts with each other and the English have taught us that surrender is never an option. We must instill pride in our armies to ensure the line never breaks."
 irish_clan_idea_6: "Embrace Primogeniture"
 irish_clan_idea_6_desc: "While much of Europe uses a system of primogeniture to decide succession, the Irish elect their rulers from among the ruler's family. We should fully embrace the more modern system of primogeniture and ensure we are up to par with our European rivals."
 irish_clan_idea_7: "Common Law"
 irish_clan_idea_7_desc: "The English have chosen to do away with our traditional laws in favour of a regulated code of law. While we still remember the old ways, the new system may prove to help standardize justice across our diverse nation."
