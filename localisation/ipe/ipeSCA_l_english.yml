 ipeSCA.3.t: "The Althing"
 ipeSCA.3.d: "The Althing is the world's oldest parliament, having been founded in Iceland in 930. The Althing made many important decisions for the peoples of the Icelandic Commonwealth, including the declaration of Christianity as the island's official faith in the year 1000. However, in the time of Norwegian and then Danish rule, the Althing gradually lost its power as the Icelandic people submitted themselves to the overseas power of the crown, before the Althing's independence was extinguished entirely during the age of Danish absolutism. However, now that we have a degree of autonomy once again, we can once again restore this prestigious historical institution."
