 ipeWAL.1.t: "Conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons"
 ipeWAL.1.d: "The Transylvanian Saxons of Hungary have long been opposed to the rule of $MONARCH$, who they have viewed as an illegitimate claimant to the Wallachian throne. The Saxons have continually refused to heed our calls to cease their support of our enemies, perhaps feeling all too safe and secure under the protection and authority of the [HUN.Monarch.GetTitle] of Hungary. The time has now come for us to do something about the situation."
 ipeWAL.1.a: "IMPALE THEM ALL!"
 impaled_saxons: "Impaled the Saxons"
 ipeWAL.1.b: "Ignore them."
 ipeWAL.2.t: "The Fate of the Transylvanian Saxons"
 ipeWAL.2.d: "Around the roads and towns of the Transylvanian Saxons, rows upon rows of impaled corpses can be found, with pikes stuck through their chests and grimacing looks of pain plastered upon their faces. The Saxons angered [WAL.Monarch.GetName] of Wallachia by supporting a pretender to the Wallachian throne, but little did they know that he would respond by impaling entire villages of the Saxons. The area now suffers from great devastation, a consequence of Wallachian barbarity."
 ipeWAL.2.a: "We must avenge them!"
 ipeWAL.3.t: "Bulgarian Refugees"
 ipeWAL.3.d: "Many Bulgarian rebels assisted the Christian coalition that participated in the Crusade of Varna. However, in the aftermath of the coalition’s defeat, many of these rebels have been sent fleeing toward Christian lands as refugees. One group of such Bulgarians has crossed the Danube into Wallachia, seeking safety."
 ipeWAL.3.a: "They are welcome to stay here."
 ipeWAL.4.t: "The Subjugation of Wallachia"
 ipeWAL.4.d: "Our forces have taken over Wallachia, an important border region of the Balkans ruled by [WAL.Monarch.GetTitle] [WAL.Monarch.GetName]. We have deposed [WAL.Monarch.GetTitle] [WAL.Monarch.GetName], making the new [WAL.Monarch.GetTitle] our puppet. Securing control of Wallachia will put us at great advantage in the general conflict between Christians and Muslims for control of the Balkans."
 ipeWAL.4.a: "Excellent."
 ipeWAL.5.t: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ Subjugates Wallachia"
 ipeWAL.5.d: "Forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have taken over Wallachia, capturing $CAPITAL$ and deposing $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has made a puppet out of the new $MONARCHTITLE$, who will now be forced to pay tribute to and obey the whims of a foreign power. As a result, we will no longer be able to choose our own path during this tumultuous era in the Balkans."
 ipeWAL.5.a: "This is not good."
 ipeWAL.6.d: "Forces from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have taken over Wallachia, deposing [WAL.Monarch.GetTitle] [WAL.Monarch.GetName] and making a puppet out of the new [WAL.Monarch.GetTitle]. Now that Wallachia will be forced to pay tribute to and obey the whims of $FROMCOUNTRY$, we will be left in a more vulnerable position in the Balkans. We must reacquire control of Wallachia as soon as possible."
 ipeWAL.7.a: "We will have to deal with the likes of him."
 ipeWAL.8.t: "The Saxons of Tîrgoviste"
 ipeWAL.8.d: "In the 13th century, Saxon colonists from Transylvania arrived in Tîrgoviste and expanded the city, making it the only town in Wallachia with Transylvanian features of organization. The considerably wealthy Saxon part of Tîrgoviste has long been its nucleus, centered around the city’s stronghold. In recent times however, the Saxon community has begun to decline, to the point that Romanians are becoming the dominant ethnic group in the city."
 ipeWAL.8.a: "Tîrgoviste will always be a Romanian city."
 ipeWAL.9.t: "The Fate of János Hunyadi"
 ipeWAL.9.d: "In the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Varna, the crusader forces of the powerful Hungarian nobleman János Hunyadi fled for Hungary, attempting to pass through the lands of Wallachia, which was nominally an Ottoman vassal. However, during their passage, Hunyadi and his men were imprisoned by Voivode Vlad II. Vlad II was ostensibly angry at Hunyadi for the failure at the Battle of Varna, especially after having attempted to dissuade the crusaders from carrying out the invasion. Now that the great János Hunyadi is in our custody, we must decide what to do with him."
 ipeWAL.9.a: "Allow Hunyadi to go free."
 ipeWAL.9.b: "Hand over Hunyadi to the Sultan."
 ipeWAL.9.b.tooltip: "§RThe Ottomans will execute János Hunyadi.§!"
 ipeWAL.9.c: "I personally order Hunyadi's execution."
 ipeWAL.10.t: "The Release of János Hunyadi"
 ipeWAL.10.d: "In the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Varna, the crusader forces of the powerful Hungarian nobleman János Hunyadi fled for Hungary, attempting to pass through the lands of Wallachia, which was nominally an Ottoman vassal. However, during their passage, Hunyadi and his men were imprisoned by Voivode Vlad II. Vlad II was ostensibly angry at Hunyadi for the failure at the Battle of Varna, especially after having attempted to dissuade the crusaders from carrying out the invasion. Fortunately for us, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] has chosen to be lenient, allowing Hunyadi to return to Hungary, accompanying him to the Hungarian-Wallachian border and bestowing generous gifts."
 ipeWAL.10.a: "A relief."
 ipeWAL.11.d: "In the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Varna, the crusader forces of the powerful Hungarian nobleman János Hunyadi fled for Hungary, attempting to pass through the lands of Wallachia, which was nominally an Ottoman vassal. However, during their passage, Hunyadi and his men were imprisoned by Voivode Vlad II. Vlad II was ostensibly angry at Hunyadi for the failure at the Battle of Varna, especially after having attempted to dissuade the crusaders from carrying out the invasion.\n\nUltimately, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] decided to hand over János Hunyadi to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, hoping to prove his loyalty to us and regain the benefit of Ottoman protection after the abject failure of the crusader forces. Given that János Hunyadi attempted to bring about the ruin and destruction of our empire, there is only one suitable punishment for the likes of him…"
 ipeWAL.11.a: "Execute Hunyadi for his crimes."
 ipeWAL.12.t: "The Execution of János Hunyadi"
 ipeWAL.12.d: "In the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Varna, the crusader forces of the powerful Hungarian nobleman János Hunyadi fled for Hungary, attempting to pass through the lands of Wallachia, which was nominally an Ottoman vassal. However, during their passage, Hunyadi and his men were imprisoned by Voivode Vlad II. Vlad II was ostensibly angry at Hunyadi for the failure at the Battle of Varna, especially after having attempted to dissuade the crusaders from carrying out the invasion.\n\nTo our dismay, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] chose to hand over Hunyadi to [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [TUR.Monarch.GetName], hoping to regain favor with the Ottomans and reacquire the benefits of Ottoman protection. Furious at Hunyadi’s attempt to destroy his empire, [TUR.Monarch.GetTitle] [TUR.Monarch.GetName] has chosen to order the execution of János Hunyadi, bringing about the untimely and unfortunate demise of one of the greatest warriors in the history of christendom."
 ipeWAL.12.a: "This is a catastrophe!"
 ipeWAL.13.d: "In the aftermath of the disastrous Battle of Varna, the crusader forces of the powerful Hungarian nobleman János Hunyadi fled for Hungary, attempting to pass through the lands of Wallachia, which was nominally an Ottoman vassal. However, during their passage, Hunyadi and his men were imprisoned by Voivode Vlad II. Vlad II was ostensibly angry at Hunyadi for the failure at the Battle of Varna, especially after having attempted to dissuade the crusaders from carrying out the invasion.\n\nTo our dismay, [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] chose to personally order the execution of János Hunyadi, hoping to deprive Hungary of strong leadership and remove a potential threat. As such, the life of János Hunyadi, one of the greatest warriors in history of christendom, has come to an untimely and unfortunate end."
