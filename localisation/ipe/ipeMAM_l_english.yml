 ipeMAM.1.t: "Mamluk Rule in Egypt"
 ipeMAM.1.d: "Despite our recent conquest of Egypt from the Mamluks, the Mamluks as an estate continue to exercise great amounts of influence in the region. While we can co-opt the Mamluks into our administration of Egypt, they will remain a difficult impediment to growing Ottoman authority for decades to come."
 ipeMAM.1.a: "It will be difficult to end Mamluk rule."
 ipeMAM.2.t: "Advancement of the Mamluks"
 ipeMAM.2.d: "Over time, the Mamluks have gained increasing amounts of influence in the country, with many of them going on to not only take up prominent military but also administrative positions. With the Mamluks gaining control over more and more aspects of our government, we should keep an eye on their rise in power, to ensure that they recognize the fact that the $MONARCHTITLE$'s will is still absolute."
 ipeMAM.2.a: "Ok."

 ipeMAM.3.t: "Declining Power of the Mamluks"
 ipeMAM.3.d: "For a myriad number of reasons, including the difficulty of purchasing new Mamluks, the lessening use of them in warfare, and the gradual loss of their positions in both military and administration, the Mamluks have been experiencing a decrease in power. For now, the Mamluks' influence is greatly diminished, and they have lost the hold over the government that they usually possess."

 ipeMAM.4.t: "Mamluk-Janissary Rivalry"
 ipeMAM.4.d: "As the two primary military castes of our nation, both originating from enslaved peoples, the Mamluks and the Janissaries have frequently been at odds with each other. The Janissaries resent the presence of large numbers of cavalrymen in the armies, while the Mamluks disdain for the disloyalty and upstart nature of the Janissaries, hoping to prove their loyalty to the $MONARCHTITLE$. With the Mamluks and the Janissaries feuding once again, we are forced to pick a side."
 ipeMAM.4.a: "Let us side with the Janissaries."
 ipeMAM.4.b: "Let us side with the Mamluks."
 ipeMAM.4.c: "Pick neither side."
 ipeMAM.6.t: "The Great Plague of Egypt"
 ipeMAM.6.d: "In 1430 and 1460, Egypt experienced two great and devastating plagues, which cemented the region's longstanding economic decline and effectively helped perpetuate a dark age in Egypt. It is estimated that 90,000 people died in Cairo in 1460, while tens of thousands in other cities and rural areas also perished. The catastrophic loss of population in Egypt to the plagues of the 15th century, which even rivaled the Black Death, resulted in the loss of much of Egypt's agricultural labor force. As the labor force dwindled, Egypt's irrigation systems began to decay from the lack of hands to maintain them, halving the area's agricultural production in comparison to its previous yields in the 14th century.\n\nNow, disease savages the city of Cairo, killing unfathomable numbers of people within the formerly bustling metropolis. Elsewhere, sickness and strife continue to spread, furthering chaos and anarchy throughout Egypt. With little way to stop the spread of disease, we will face hard times, for a long time."
 ipeMAM.6.a: "The times are unforgiving to us."
