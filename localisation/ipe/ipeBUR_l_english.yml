 ipeBUR.1.t: "The Duchy of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.1.d: "On June 25, 1423, Reinald IV, the Duke of Guelders and Jülich died and left no heirs. While the Duchy of Jülich went to his nephew Gerhard VII, the succession to the Duchy of Guelders became disputed, and a new noble dynasty, the House of Egmond, took power in Gelre. While at first the claim of Arnold von Egmond was weak, he managed to successfully appease the local nobility by expanding their privileges, and successfully defended the Duchy against an invasion by Gerhard VII, winning Burgundian support for his cause.\n\nWith our recent defeat at the hands of the Egmonds, it is perhaps time to move on from our claims to the Duchy. Although the Duke of Burgundy has been supportive of the Duke of Guelders, he might be interested in buying our claim to the Gelren lands, to provide himself another opportunity to expand his own power."
 ipeBUR.1.a: "Let us try to dispose of our claims."
 ipeBUR.1.a.tooltip: "We will attempt to sell the claim to the throne of Guelders to Burgundy."
 ipeBUR.1.b: "But Gelre will be ours!"
 ipeBUR.2.d: "On June 25, 1423, Reinald IV, the Duke of Guelders and Jülich died and left no heirs. While the Duchy of Jülich went to his nephew Gerhard VII, the succession to the Duchy of Guelders became disputed, and a new noble dynasty, the House of Egmond, took power in Gelre. While at first the claim of Arnold von Egmond was weak, he managed to successfully appease the local nobility by expanding their privileges, and successfully defended the Duchy against an invasion by Gerhard VII, winning Burgundian support for his cause.\n\nDiplomats from the Duchy of Berg are now offering to sell their Duke's claim to the Duchy of Guelders, which would allow us to claim the territory for ourselves. If we take up this offer, we could become ever more powerful as monarchs of the Low Countries."
 ipeBUR.2.a: "We shall purchase their claim!"
 ipeBUR.2.b: "Sounds troublesome."
 ipeBUR.3.t: "The Duke of Burgundy Claims Guelders!"
 ipeBUR.3.d: "Intrigued, the Duke of Burgundy has taken us up on our offer to sell the claim to the throne of Guelders, agreeing to pay a sizable sum for the right to the land. That said, having a claim to the land and actually owning it are two entirely different matters."
 ipeBUR.3.a: "Best of luck to them."
 ipeBUR.4.t: "The Duke of Burgundy Turns Us Down"
 ipeBUR.4.d: "Recognizing that it might be militarily costly to seize the Duchy of Guelders for himself, the Duke of Burgundy has declined to take us up on our offer to purchase the claim to the Duchy of Guelders, saying that is a matter best left to die. We are surprised that the expansionist monarchs of Burgundy have curbed their ambitions in such a way."
 ipeBUR.4.a: "They are not entirely wrong."
 ipeBUR.5.t: "The Question of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.5.d: "Recently, the Dukes of Burgundy have acquired a claim to rule the Duchy of Guelders, undoubtedly seeking to expand their vast domains in the Low Countries. Although the predecessors of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ worked actively in order to stem the colossal growth of Burgundian power, it appears that we have been too late to halt their meteoric rise.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is concerned about his safety and the possibility of whether war might break out with Burgundy. As a result, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is contemplating whether the Duchy of Guelders should simply just be sold to the rapacious Duke of Burgundy."
 ipeBUR.5.a: "We should not oppose them."
 ipeBUR.5.a.tooltip: "If the Burgundians take up our offer to sell them the Duchy of Guelders, we will fall under a personal union with them."
 ipeBUR.5.b: "They are of no concern to us."
 ipeBUR.6.t: "The Sale of Guelders"
 ipeBUR.6.d: "Wary of the growing might of the $MONARCHTITLE$ of $COUNTRY$, the fearful ruler of Guelders now offers us an opportunity to purchase his lands entirely, making it yet another territory ruled by $MONARCH$ in personal union with Burgundy. Should we take them up on their offer?"
 ipeBUR.6.a: "It would be a worthy possession!"
 ipeBUR.6.b: "Their fears of us are unfounded."
 ipeBUR.7.t: "The Duchy of Guelders Sold!"
 ipeBUR.7.d: "Unsurprisingly, the Duke of Burgundy has taken us up on our offer to sell the Duchy of Guelders, paying a sizable sum in return for rulership over the Duchy. We are now subjects of Burgundy, with the last Duke of Guelders moving elsewhere in order to live a peaceful and contemplative life."
 ipeBUR.7.a: "May they rule justly."
 ipeBUR.8.t: "Burgundy Refuses to Purchase Guelders!"
 ipeBUR.8.d: "To our amazement, the Duke of Burgundy has refused to purchase the Duchy of Guelders, insisting that he poses no threat to our independence. While it will take time to see whether his reassurances are real, we should be grateful for his exercise of restraint despite holding tremendous power."
 ipeBUR.8.a: "We admire their magnanimity."

 desc_ipe_order_of_golden_fleece: "Founded in Bruges in 1430 by Philippe le Bon, the Duke of Burgundy, the Order of the Golden Fleece is by far the most prestigious and historic order of chivalry in the entire world. To become a knight of the Golden Fleece is a mark of great status, and reflects positively upon ourselves."

Per the stipulations of the Treaty, we cannot ally England until Philippe's death. If we attempt to circumvent the treaty and wage war on France before the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War, we will experience dire consequences as a result."
 ipeBUR.9.t: "The End of the Treaty of Arras"
 ipeBUR.9.d: "In 1435, the Congress of Arras secured a lasting peace between Burgundy and France. Philippe le Bon withdrew from the Hundred Years’ War, in return for no longer having to pay homage to King Charles VII of France. The Burgundian withdrawal allowed Charles VII to regain authority throughout France, culminating in the liberation of Paris in 1436.\n\nNow however, [BUR.Monarch.GetName] has broken the Treaty of Arras, waging war against France in order to help England in the Hundred Years’ War. As a result of the Burgundian decision to break the Treaty, [FRA.Monarch.GetName] has declared [BUR.Monarch.GetName]’s rights null and void, giving us motive to reclaim the lands of Burgundy."

Furthermore, our abrogation of the Treaty has outraged the Papacy, which wrote legal opinions absolving us of our diplomatic obligations to England."
 ipeBUR.10.a: "We care for no such treaties!"
 ipeBUR.11.t: "Charles the Bold"
 ipeBUR.11.d: "Ever since the time of his youth, young Charles has always had a deep fascination with military matters, eagerly seeking combat at every opportunity in order to expand the lands of his growing inheritance. Now that he has come of age, Charles eagerly wishes to lead the Burgundian armies on the battlefield, hoping to show his mettle and win further glory. He will live nobly up to his status as a Knight of the Golden Fleece."
 ipeBUR.11.a: "He will make an excellent general."
 ipeBUR.12.t: "The Extinction of the House de Bourgogne"
 ipeBUR.12.d: "The House de Bourgogne has gone extinct, leaving no rightful claimant to the lands of Burgundy. As a result, both the King of France and the Holy Roman Emperor can now lay claim to the Burgundian territories within the borders of France and the Holy Roman Empire. Only time will tell who will emerge dominant in the competition for these territories."

 ipeBUR.13.t: "The House de Bourgogne"
 ipeBUR.13.d: "The Duchy of Burgundy is not an independent state, and has always been subservient to the Kingdom of France, at least legally. Although Philippe le Bon waged war against the Kingdom of France during the Hundred Years' War, since then he has recognized the Treaty of Arras, once again becoming a nominal vassal of the French crown, and promising to never again ally with the likes of England.\n\nBeyond the reach of France however, we have also become gained incredible influence and power in the Low Countries, as Philippe and his predecessors secured various territories throughout the region, including Holland, Brabant, Flanders, and most recently, Luxembourg. The prosperous mercantile territories of the Low Countries are invaluable to the Burgundian State, but they too are at least partially subject to the whims of a foreign monarch, the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nShould the House de Bourgogne go extinct, with no heirs, male or female, the Kingdom of France and the Holy Roman Empire will undoubtedly press their legal claims to the Burgundian territories in their jurisdiction, bringing about a sure end to the Burgundian State. Only by elevating Burgundy to the status of a kingdom in its own right can we prevent such a fate."
 ipeBUR.13.a: "Unnerving."

 ipeBUR.14.a: "We welcome back the citizens of Nevers."
 ipeBUR.15.t: "The Inheritance of Saint-Pol"
 ipeBUR.15.d: "The last Count of Saint-Pol has died without heirs. With no viable heirs for the succession, control of the County of Saint-Pol has reverted to us, further expanding the lands of the Burgundian State."
 ipeBUR.15.a: "Saint-Pol's lands are a fine addition to our own."
 ipeBUR.16.t: "The Allegiance of Nevers"
 ipeBUR.16.d: "Ever since the accession of Charles as [BUR.Monarch.GetTitle] of Burgundy, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has become increasingly displeased with Charles' behavior, and his extremely bellicose nature in running the Burgundian State. Unsurprisingly, Charles and $MONARCH$ have often clashed and been at odds, to the point that $MONARCH$ is now considering turning against Charles, instead seeking the protection of the King of France."

Although Soest profited greatly from having access to the hinterland of the Duchy of Westphalia, one of Cologne’s territories, the city has recently rebelled against increasingly oppressive Cologner rule, placing itself under the protection of the Duke of Cleves. As a result, Cleves, in the past an ally of Burgundy, has gone to war with Cologne for possession of the city. The war has caused great destruction in the countryside, and it appears likely that the outnumbered forces of Cleves will eventually be forced to surrender to those of Cologne.
