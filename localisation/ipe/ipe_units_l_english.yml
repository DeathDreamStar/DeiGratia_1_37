 falconetDESCR: "The falconet is a light cannon of the 15th century, named as such because it fired a shot similar in size and weight to a falcon. The falconet has a barrel approximately four feet in length, and is capable of firing a one-pound shot for a range of up to 5,000 feet."
 bombard: "Bombard"
 bombardDESCR: "A bombard is a cannon or mortar, which has historically been used predominantly in sieges, but also has seen application on the battlefield. Such guns were deployed at the Battle of Crecy by the English in 1346, and were used to capture Harfleur. However, the French would adapt to this new manner of warfare, and return fire upon the English at the later Battle of Agincourt."

 romanian_voinici: "Romanian Voinici"
 romanian_voiniciDESCR: "Stephen the Great of Moldavia forced all farmers and villagers into his country to bear arms, claiming that every man had a duty to defend the fatherland. By promoting men from the landed free peasantry to infantry known as voinci, Stephen was able to raise large armies capable of responding to any crisis, including Ottoman, Polish, and Hungarian invasions. Such troops wielded swords and bows, and could not be kept for long because the economy and population growth were paralyzed by such large-scale mobilization."
 romanian_hansari: "Romanian Hansari"
 romanian_hansariDESCR: "Inspired by the Serbian Hussars that joined their forces, the Moldavians formed their own contingent of light cavalry known as hansari. The hansari went to war in return for the right to receive loot from battlefields, and were usually free men or small landholding peasants."
 reformed_romanian_voinici: "Reformed Romanian Voinici"
 reformed_romanian_voiniciDESCR: "The use of free peasants to provide manpower for Stephen’s armies reduced his reliance on the boyars for military support. In order to defeat numerically superior foes, Stephen made use of scorched earth, hit-and-run, and ambush tactics to achieve decisive victories. Stephen the Great inflicted a tremendous defeat on an Ottoman army 120,000 strong with his 40,000 army at Vaslui, luring his enemies with light cavalry before whittling them down with concentrated volley and artillery fire, ultimately launching an encircling counterattack that resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman army."
 reformed_romanian_hansari: "Reformed Romanian Hansari"
 reformed_romanian_hansariDESCR: "The hansari were organized in units called vatafi, and were led by an officer known as a vataf. The hansari were lightly armored, being only protected by a wing shield and armed with a long cavalry spear. Such light armament however gave the hansari the ability to strike with great speed on the battlefield, especially where the enemy is weak."
 romanian_lefegii: "Romanian Lefegii"
 romanian_lefegiiDESCR: "The lefegii were the professional troops of Wallachia and Moldavia, being paid wages or exempted from taxes in exchange for their service. The lefegii began to increasingly use handguns such as the arquebus, but these weapons could be unreliable because they were unusable in rainy weather and prone to misfire. However, the arquebus was nonetheless an intimidating weapon and could induce enemies to rout if used at the opportune moment."
 romanian_viteji: "Romanian Viteji"
 romanian_vitejiDESCR: "Both the Wallachians and Moldavians formed units of medium cavalry known as viteji, which consisted largely of the nobility and their guards. During times of war, boyars were compelled by feudal allegiance to supply the Prince with troops according to the extent of their domains. The viteji were highly versatile, and often imitated Cuman and Tatar horse archers, or Ottoman spahi, being able to counter and harass enemy cavalry flanks before leading decisive charges."
 early_swiss_pikes: "Early Swiss Pikes"
 early_swiss_pikesDESCR: "The Swiss cantons fielded one of the most effective military forces of the Middle Ages, innovating with the organization of pikemen in column and square formations. Disciplined Swiss soldiers were able to maneuver swiftly in order to facilitate mass attacks that usually proved decisive."
 swiss_pikes: "Swiss Pikes"
 swiss_pikesDESCR: "Swiss pikemen were frequently employed in wars throughout Europe. One of their most defining moments was during the Burgundian Wars, where they crushed the troops of Charles the Bold at the Battles of Grandson and Murten. At Nancy, the Duke of Lorraine René of Anjou employed a Swiss mercenary pike core that won victory against the Burgundians, killing Charles the Bold and bringing an end to his nascent empire. It is famously said by the Swiss of Charles the Bold that, in Grandson, he lost his goods - in Murten, he lost his courage and in Nancy, he lost his blood."
 late_swiss_pikes: "Late Swiss Pikes"
 late_swiss_pikesDESCR: "The French made extensive use of Swiss pikemen throughout the Italian Wars, using them to achieving suzerainty over Milan and Naples. The zenith of the reputation of the Swiss mercenaries came at this time, with the victory of Novara making Milan effectively a puppet of the Swiss Confederacy. However, the bloody Battle of Marignano, which ended in Swiss defeat, resulted the end of Swiss domination over Milan as the Swiss signed the Perpetual Peace, creating the foundations of future Swiss neutrality. Eventually, the transition to the more extensive use of gunpowder weapons in early modern warfare would render the Swiss pikes obsolete. Nonetheless, their reputation lives on."
