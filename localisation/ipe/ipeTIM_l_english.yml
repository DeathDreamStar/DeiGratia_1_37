 ipeTIM.1.t: "The Timurid Renaissance"
 ipeTIM.1.d: "Although the era of the Timurid Empire was often remembered for its carnage under the warlord Timur, it can also be remembered for the cultural and academic rebirth that ensued, which constituted its own Islamic renaissance. Persian artistic traits became interwoven with Mongol art, while Samarqand and Herat became focal points for artistic culture as Persian intellectuals moved to these cities in increasing numbers.\n\nTimurid architecture, quality metalwork, Chinese-style ceramics, and Islamic scholarship, especially in fields like astronomy and mathematics, all became defining features of the Timurid Renaissance. These are some of the most glorious days in the history of the Timurid Empire."

Many of the cities of western Iran swore their allegiance to Sultan Muhammad, including Yazd, Rey, and Hamadan.

 ipeTIM.7.d: "Although he was once the greatest of all the living Timurid dynasts, Shah Rukh is dead. By force of his formidable reputation and strength of personality, Shah Rukh firmly held together the loose strands of an unstable empire, crushing upstart family members and subjugating foreign threats at every turn. Now that the Timurids are deprived of their greatest leader however, squabbling princes have begun to each carve out their own personal fiefdoms from the ruins of the mighty empire, all hoping that one day they may further capitalize on their gains, reuniting the empire in its entirety, just as Shah Rukh himself did when Timur died many decades ago.\n\n$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has inherited the bulk of Shah Rukh’s former domain, governing from $CAPITAL$ and waiting for the right opportunity to conquer his fellow princes. However, not all is well in the Timurid remnant, as two more Timurid princes have begun to partition $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s remaining lands, amassing forces on the frontiers. The fearsome Babur bin Baysonqor has won the allegiance of the cities of Khorasan, while Sanjar bin Umar Shaikh has taken custody of Merv. Neither will easily yield to us now that they have secured these gains, and we will risk war if we do not duly negotiate with them."
