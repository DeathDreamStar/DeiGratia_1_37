 ipe_war_of_the_roses.1.d: "The apparent weakness of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$’s reign over England has led many among the nobility to question the right of the House of $DYNASTY$ to govern the country. Amid the turmoil of $MONARCH$’s tumultuous rule, two junior branches of the old House of Plantagenet, the House of Lancaster and the House of York, both claim to be the rightful heir to the throne of England. Sporadic fights between supporters of these two great families have already broken out in a number of provinces around the country. Their heraldic symbols, a red rose and a white rose, have become synonymous with the conflict now commonly known as the War of the Roses."
