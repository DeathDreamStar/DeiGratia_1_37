Dmitry has been accused of spreading heretical beliefs throughout Russia, in addition to committing sodomy. The outrageous claims have been only gained further traction because of Dmitry’s tendency to surround himself with foreigners who flout Russian customs. Huge numbers of boyars and commoners alike stormed the Kremlin, and although Dmitry tried to escape, he was ultimately dragged out and killed by the boyars who wished to promptly dispose of him. In the aftermath, Dmitry’s supporters were also massacred, and the mobs celebrated as the supposed blood of heretics was spilled on the streets of $CAPITAL$.\n\nIn the wake of the bloodshed, Vasiliy Shuisky has become the newest $MONARCHTITLE$ of Russia.
