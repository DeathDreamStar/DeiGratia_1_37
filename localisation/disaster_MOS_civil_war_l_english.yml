 MOS_civil_war.1.t: "Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.1.d: "On May 19, 1389, the Grand Kniaz of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, leaving behind his son Vasily I as successor. However, Donskoy also willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then Vasily’s brother, Yury Dmitrievich, would become Grand Kniaz. When Vasily I died in 1425, he chose his son Vasily II to succeed him, but instead Yury Dmietrevich and his sons began to wage an open war for the throne, beginning the Muscovite Civil War.\n\nSince then, Vasily II has secured a barely tenable peace with Dmitry Shemyaka, one of the sons of Yury Dmitrievich, staving off war for nearly a decade. But peace is no sign of unity. Even when the armies of Kazani Khan laid siege to the walls of Moscow itself, a reticent Dmitry Shemyaka refused to come to Vasily’s aid.\n\nNow however, Dmitry Shemyaka’s power is growing, and there are reports that he has begun to gather increasing numbers of troops from the Muscovite countryside. Not all the princes of Rus’ are united in opposition to Shemyaka, and many see in Shemyaka’s uprising a unique opportunity to carve out greater personal fiefdoms for themselves. A renewal of Muscovy’s decades-old civil war can only be imminent…"

 MOS_civil_war.2.t: "The Qasim Khanate"
 MOS_civil_war.2.d: "In the time since it splintered off the Golden Horde in 1438, the Khanate of Kazan has consistently waged war against Muscovy and the other Rus’ principalities, in hopes of reclaiming those lands that were formerly under the overlordship of the Tatars. Among these territories is Qasim, which is inhabited by our kinsmen in language and faith.\n\nDmitry Shemyaka has laid claim to the Muscovite throne once again, suddenly renewing that country’s decades-old civil war. With the rebirth of anarchy in the lands of Muscovy, we may yet be able to seize Qasim from [MOS.Monarch.GetName]’s enfeebled government."
 MOS_civil_war.2.a: "Qasim must be freed from the Muscovite yoke."
 MOS_civil_war.2.b: "It is none of our concern."
 MOS_civil_war.3.d: "The hitherto short history of the Khanate of Kazan has been characterized by constant warfare against the likes of Muscovy, and it appears that this will not yet change.\n\nEmboldened by the ongoing Muscovite Civil War, envoys from the Khanate of Kazan dispatched by [KAZ.Monarch.GetName] now issue demands that [MOS.Monarch.GetName] cede control of Qasim to Kazan, or otherwise potentially face renewed warfare with the Khan’s armies.\n\nWe have not readily forgotten about the grave costs of the last Kazani raid on Moscow in 1439. If we are forced to contend with both the armies of Dmitry Shemyaka and [KAZ.Monarch.GetName], we may be utterly crushed."
 MOS_civil_war.3.a: "They will not press us."
 MOS_civil_war.3.b: "We must concede to their demands."
 MOS_civil_war.4.t: "The Oppression of Qasim"
 MOS_civil_war.4.d: "[MOS.Monarch.GetName] has stubbornly refused to make us any concessions, refusing to take any heed of our threats. If the Muscovites will not negotiate for Qasim, we will liberate it through war."
 MOS_civil_war.4.a: "This will be the end of Rus'!"
 MOS_civil_war.5.t: "The Liberation of Qasim"
 MOS_civil_war.5.d: "Severely beleaguered by the pressures of the ongoing civil war, [MOS.Monarch.GetName] has decided to make concessions to us, ceding us Qasim in return for the short respite of peace. [MOS.Monarch.GetName] hopes that with us temporarily appeased, he will have enough time to overcome the forces of Dmitry Shemyaka."
 MOS_civil_war.5.a: "Make my brother Khan of Qasim."
 MOS_civil_war.5.b: "I will rule Qasim myself!"
 MOS_civil_war.6.t: "The Muscovite Throne"
 MOS_civil_war.6.d: "On May 19, 1389, the Grand Kniaz of Moscow Dmitry Donskoy died, leaving behind his son Vasily I as successor. However, Donskoy also willed that if Vasily died in infancy, then Vasily’s brother, Yury Dmitrievich, would become Grand Kniaz. When Vasily I died in 1425, he chose his son Vasily II to succeed him, but instead Yury Dmietrevich and his sons began to wage an open war for the throne, beginning the Muscovite Civil War.\n\nSince then, Vasily II has secured a barely tenable peace with Dmitry Shemyaka, one of the sons of Yury Dmitrievich, staving off war for nearly a decade.

Not all the princes of Rus’ are united in opposition to us, and many see in our uprising a unique opportunity to carve out greater personal fiefdoms for themselves. The time has come to renew Muscovy’s decades-old civil war."
 MOS_civil_war.6.a: "I am Grand Prince of Rus'!"
 MOS_civil_war.6.a.tooltip: "To win the Muscovite Civil War, we must capture the capital of Muscovy. However, we will lose the war if Muscovy captures the capital of Galich or Dmitry Shemyaka dies early."

 MOS_civil_war.7.t: "The Rebellion of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.7.d: "As anticipated, Dmitry Shemyaka, son of Yury Dmitrievich, has pressed his claim to the Muscovite throne once again and risen up in rebellion. The fragile peace which characterized the last decade is over, and the armies of Galich are now marching upon Moscow…\n\nIf Muscovy is to become a strong and mighty state, the rebellions of lesser nobles such as Shemyaka must be crushed. The future of Muscovy and all Rus’ hangs in the balance."

 MOS_civil_war.7.a.tooltip: "To win the Muscovite Civil War, we must capture the capital of Galich, or Dmitry Shemyaka must die early. However, we will lose the war if Galich captures the capital of Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.12.t: "The Fall of Moscow"
 MOS_civil_war.12.d: "After a long and ruthless siege, the forces of Dmitry Shemyaka have finally marched triumphantly into Moscow, seizing the city’s kremlin and enthroning Shemyaka as Grand Kniaz of Muscovy. [MOS.Monarch.GetName] has been captured by Shemyaka’s forces and blinded, likely to never rule again. The population, weary from decades of conflict, has no desire to resist further. The decades-long Muscovite Civil War has finally come to a lasting conclusion."
 MOS_civil_war.12.a: "A tragic end."
 MOS_civil_war.13.t: "The Flight of Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.13.d: "Dmitry Shemyaka’s Principality of Galich has finally been captured by Muscovite forces, stymying his efforts of revolt. Recognizing the untenability of the situation, Shemyaka has now fled abroad, leaving his armies in disarray as the plunder mercilessly and haphazardly along the path of their retreat. If we do not wish to experience further insurrections, it is best that we pursue Shemyaka and finish him off once and for all."
 MOS_civil_war.13.a: "He will not escape."
 MOS_civil_war.14.t: "Chasing Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.14.d: "At long last, our agents have ascertained the location of Dmitry Shemyaka, finding his new quarters within the city of Novgorod. Even in Novgorod, Shemyaka has continued to plot against us to retake the throne. Only by ending Dmitry Shemyaka’s life will we be able to finally bring a definitive end to the Muscovite Civil War, securing for Muscovy a permanent and lasting peace."
 MOS_civil_war.14.a: "Poison him."
 MOS_civil_war.14.a.tooltip: "Our agents will attempt to kill Dmitry Shemyaka by poisoning."

 MOS_civil_war.15.t: "Qasimi Allegiances"
 MOS_civil_war.15.d: "Although $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is a kinsman of the Khan of Kazan, he has greatly chafed under Kazani domination, seeking more freedom and independence for himself. If the [MOS.Monarch.GetTitle] of Muscovy were willing to pay a price, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ says, we could become allegiant to Muscovy instead."
 MOS_civil_war.15.a: "Offer to serve Muscovy."
 MOS_civil_war.15.a.tooltip: "Muscovy may pay to receive us as a subject."
 MOS_civil_war.15.b: "Forget about it."
 MOS_civil_war.16.d: "Under the domination of the Khan of Kazan, [QAS.Monarch.GetTitle] [QAS.Monarch.GetName] of Qasim has chafed, seeking much greater liberty and independence in his rule. Dissatisfied with Kazan, the Qasimis have now turned to us, offering to change their allegiance from Kazan to Muscovy if they were to be paid for their troubles. Such a change would once again set the balance of power in the region back in Muscovy’s favor."
 MOS_civil_war.16.a: "Make Qasim a Muscovite subject."

 MOS_civil_war.17.d: "[MOS.Monarch.GetName] of Muscovy has agreed to the terms of our proposal, paying us in return for Qasim becoming a Muscovite subject, with us leaving behind the protection of the Khan of Kazan. The balance of power in the region has shifted in Muscovy’s favor once again."
 MOS_civil_war.17.a: "Excellent."
 MOS_civil_war.18.t: "The Betrayal of Qasim"
 MOS_civil_war.18.d: "Even though [QAS.Monarch.GetName] of Qasim is a kinsman of [KAZ.Monarch.GetName], he has decided to switch allegiance from Kazan to Muscovy, doing so for only a meager price of gold. Qasim’s shift in allegiance alters the balance of power in the region in Muscovy’s favor yet again, setting back the gains we made in Qasim previously."
 MOS_civil_war.18.a: "These traitors must be punished!"
 MOS_civil_war.19.t: "The Death of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.19.d: "At long last, Dmitry Shemyaka has perished, and with him his competing claim to the throne of Muscovy. The Principality of Galich has thus reverted to Muscovite control, and Shemyaka’s armies have disbanded. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ now reigns supreme in the Grand Principality, and is the foremost and only true claimant to the title of Grand Prince of Rus’."
 MOS_civil_war.19.a: "We will have peace."
 MOS_civil_war.20.t: "The Khanate Denied"
 MOS_civil_war.20.d: "Much to the dismay of [QAS.Monarch.GetName], the Muscovites have refused to take up our offer to switch allegiances from the Khanate of Kazan. Apparently, they believe that their gold is more important than our alliance."
 MOS_civil_war.20.a: "Unfortunate."
 MOS_civil_war.69.t: "The Demise of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.69.d: "The cunning of our agents has secured the untimely but welcome death of Dmitry Shemyaka, whose cooks were bribed to poison him. With Shemyaka’s violent end, we will no longer have to contend with his false line of Muscovite princes."
 MOS_civil_war.69.a: "His passing will not be mourned."
 MOS_civil_war.70.t: "Shemyaka Lives!"
 MOS_civil_war.70.d: "As a consequence of our agents’ incompetence, the dastardly Shemyaka has managed to just barely escape death, now fleeing to Lithuania in search of safer refuge following our failed attempt on his life. Furthermore, the agents’ ties to $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ were exposed, damaging our reputation, such that many rebellious members of the nobility have begun to rise up, promising to enact revenge upon us for our dishonorable actions. The civil war has clearly yet to come to a close."
 MOS_civil_war.70.a: "They will be crushed!"
 MOS_civil_war.100.t: "End of the Muscovite Civil War"
 MOS_civil_war.100.d: "After many decades of strife, the Muscovite Civil War has finally come to an end. Muscovy is left in ruins, and it will take time for the country to rebuild from the carnage of the civil war. Nonetheless, the political implications of this vast and desperate conflict will last for years to come, for the Russian lands have changed forever."
 MOS_civil_war.100.a: "Indeed."
 MOS_civil_war.102.t: "The Return of Dmitry Shemyaka"
 MOS_civil_war.102.d: "After spending some time in exile, Dmitry Shemyaka has at last returned to $CAPITAL$ with a substantial and formidable army.
