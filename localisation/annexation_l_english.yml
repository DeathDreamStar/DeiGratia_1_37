 annexation.1.t: "Collapse of the Mamluk Sultanate"
 annexation.1.d: "In 1515, Sultan Selim I began the war which led to the Ottoman conquest Egypt and its dependencies. Mamluk cavalry proved no match for the Ottoman artillery and Janissary infantry. On 24 August 1516, at the Battle of Marj Dabiq, Mamluk Sultan Al-Ghawri was killed. Syria passed into Turkish possession, an event welcomed in many places as deliverance from the Mamluks. The Mamluk Sultanate survived in Egypt until 1517, when Selim captured Cairo. Although diminished in power, the Mamluks were retained by the Ottomans as an Egyptian ruling class, and the Burji family succeeded in regaining much of its influence.\n\nThe Mamluks are incredibly corrupted, and leaving them in privilege will do naught for Egypt. Nonetheless, without their support, we will be unable to rule this region as easily. What should we do?"
 annexation.1.a: "We shall rule Egypt directly."
 annexation.1.a.tooltip: "§GAll Mamluk provinces will be ceded to the Ottomans.§!"
 annexation.1.b: "Do not infringe on the authority of the local Mamluks."
 annexation.1.b.tooltip: "§GAll Mamluk provinces outside of Egypt and Sudan will be ceded to the Ottomans. If you do not choose to do this now, you will be able to release the Mamluks by decision later.§!"

 annexation.2.t: "The Fall of Novgorod"
 annexation.2.d: "Throughout the 14th century, Lithuania and Muscovy fought intensely for control of Novgorod and its extravagant wealth, accrued from control of the lucrative fur trade in the Russian north. As Muscovy grew in strength, its princes became an increasingly greater threat to Novgorod. Thus, the Novgordians began to turn to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth for security, pursuing an alliance in the 1470s. However, this encouraged the wrath of Muscovy, and so Grand Prince of Moscow Ivan III went to war with Novgorod and took the city in 1478 - he destroyed the Veche bell, the ancient symbol of Novgorod's republican traditions, and ended the independence of Novgorod. \n\nA Muscovite onslaught has the potential to instill incredible fear, horror, and anger among the once free and prosperous Novgorodian people. Should Muscovy seize the lands of the north?"
 annexation.2.a: "Bring the Novgorodian domains into the Muscovite fold!"
 annexation.3.t: "The Demise of the Qara Qoyunlu"
 annexation.3.d: "Born from the ruins of the Timurid Empire, the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu were rival hordes known respectively as the White Sheep and Black Sheep Turkomans. For many decades, they competed for control of the Middle East and dominance over Timur's former domains. In 1467, Uzun Hasan, the Shahanshah of the Aq Qoyunlu, defeated Jahan Shah, the Sultan of the Qara Qoyunlu at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was slain in battle and the Qara Qoyunlu promptly collapsed, with their lands being rapidly subsumed by their rivals. \n\nShould we seize the territories of our enemies?"
 annexation.3.a: "The time of the White Sheep has come!"
 annexation.4.d: "For centuries, the rulers of Ardabil have governed an inconspicuous domain in the shadow of great empires such as the Timurids and the Qara Qoyunlu. However, Ardabili forces have now sacked the Qara Qoyunlu capital, bringing great ruin and devastation to that country. Consequently, the Qara Qoyunlu state now teeters upon the brink of collapse.\n\nIf $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ were to take control of the lands of the Qara Qoyunlu, he would be able to transform $COUNTRY$ into one of the most dominant forces of a new Middle East. Should we seize the territories of our enemies?"
 annexation.4.a: "This is the beginning of a new Persian Empire!"
 annexation.5.t: "The Downfall of the Aq Qoyunlu"
 annexation.5.d: "For centuries, the rulers of Ardabil have governed an inconspicuous domain in the shadow of great empires such as the Timurids and the Qara Qoyunlu. However, Ardabili forces have now sacked the Aq Qoyunlu capital, bringing great ruin and devastation to that country. Consequently, the Aq Qoyunlu state now teeters upon the brink of collapse.\n\nIf $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ were to take control of the lands of the Aq Qoyunlu, he would be able to transform $COUNTRY$ into one of the most dominant forces of a new Middle East. Should we seize the territories of our enemies?"
 annexation.5.a: "We will become the new rulers of the Middle East!"
 annexation.6.t: "The Crumbling of the Qara Qoyunlu"
 annexation.6.d: "Born from the ruins of the Timurid Empire, the Aq Qoyunlu and Qara Qoyunlu have long jockeyed for power and dominance in the Middle East, competing ruthlessly with each other in an endless tribal feud, characterized by steadily increasing antagonism and violence. In 1467, Uzun Hasan, the Shahanshah of the Aq Qoyunlu, defeated Jahan Shah, the Sultan of the Qara Qoyunlu at the Battle of Chapakchur. Jahan Shah was slain in battle and the Qara Qoyunlu promptly collapsed, with their lands being rapidly subsumed by their rivals. \n\nThe ruler of the Qara Qoyunlu has now perished in battle with the forces of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, bringing the Qara Qoyunlu state to the brink of collapse. It is time for the White Sheep to fill the power vacuum."
 annexation.7.t: "The Conquest of Ajam"
 annexation.7.d: "For many years, the lands of Ajam were under the rule of a branch of the Timurid dynasty. However, in recent times, the rulers of Ajam broke away from the Timurid sphere of influence, thus depriving themselves of the protection provided by their former overlords. Amid this power vacuum, we have seized the capital of Ajam, and now have the option to seize the country's lands and begin our mission to form a new Persian Empire."
 annexation.7.a: "Seize the lands of Ajam!"
 annexation.10.t: "The Fall of Delhi"
 annexation.10.d: "In 1398, the great conqueror Timur sacked the city of Delhi, but did not stay. While he left the great metropolis and capital of the Delhi Sultanate in ruins, it would be Khizr Khan of the Sayyid dynasty who succeeded the enfeebled Tughlaqs. In the time since then, northern India has become fraught with political fracturing and turmoil, as many of the old Tughlaq generals rose up and founded glorious kingdoms of their own. However, even amid the quarreling of the lesser kingdoms, the city of Delhi still has retained its historical prestige as the imperial seat of India. Whoever holds Delhi can claim to have authority over the whole subcontinent.\n\nThe year $YEAR$ will be forever remembered as the year we first marched into Delhi, for it will herald the rising of an Indian empire mightier than any ever before seen. According to $MONARCHTITLE $ $MONARCH$, it will be an age of riches and spoils unforetold."
 annexation.10.a: "We will bring India a new dawn."
 annexation.11.t: "The Fall of Jaunpur"
 annexation.11.d: "In 1394, the Jaunpur Sultanate achieved its independence from the declining Delhi Sultanate. For decades, the Sharqi dynasty achieved mastery over the plains of the Ganges, establishing one of India’s wealthiest and most powerful kingdoms. However, Jaunpur will now follow the fate of Delhi, crumbling before our armies as we continue our campaign to unite the whole of India under our banner."
 annexation.11.a: "Jaunpur will be a worthy addition to our domain."
 annexation.15.t: "The Last of the Mushasha"
 annexation.15.d: "Since the middle of the 15th century, the Mushasha, a Shia millenarian sect, controlled Khuzestan and the southern parts of Iraq. They long feuded with our order, the Safaviya, over questions of religious doctrine. However, we have now come to conquer the lands of the Mushasha, and as such, have proven the veracity of our interpretation of the Islamic faith by means of force. Now how shall we treat the conquered?"
 annexation.15.a: "Annex their lands into our rising empire."
 annexation.17.t: "The Fall of Granada"
 annexation.17.d: "From 1250 onward, the Emirate of Granada was the last part of the Iberian Peninsula ruled by the Muslims, who had been forced southward after hundreds of years of clashing with the Christians during the Reconquista. The Nasrid dynasty governed the Emirate from their seat of power at the Alhambra palace complex in the capital city of Granada, which was a cultural gemstone of the Islamic world, flourishing on the trade route between Europe and sub-Saharan Africa. However, now Christian forces have seized control of the city, defeating the armies beyond it, overwhelming its walls, and swarming in through the gates. It is the end of an era in Iberia, and the fall of al-Andalus will be matched by the rise of Spain."
 annexation.17.a: "Seize control of the Emirate!"
 annexation.18.t: "The Conquest of Iraq"
 annexation.18.d: "Our forces have marched on the lands of Iraq, and seized the capital of the country. Iraq has long been the beating heart of the Shia world, being a site of pilgrimage for so many Shia Muslims from all over the region. Incorporating these lands into our realm would increase our prestige greatly."
 annexation.18.a: "We wield the swords of Iraq!"
 annexation.20.t: "The Fall of Delhi"
 annexation.20.d: "$MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$, the ambitious governor of Sirhind, has conspired all his life to conquer the Delhi Sultanate. Although the Lodis failed in their attempt to take Delhi in 1443, this time they have found success, thanks to the assistance of Turkic and Afghan chiefs, and ministers seeking to overthrow the old order in Delhi. With the Lodis now in control of Delhi, the great powers of the Indian subcontinent should begin to fear the rise of a newly empowered and resurgent Delhi in the west."
 annexation.20.a: "Delhi will rise again!"
 annexation.21.t: "The Fall of the Shirvanshahs"
 annexation.21.d: "For centuries, the Shirvanshahs have governed Azerbaijan, enduring all manner of invasions from Arabs, Mongols, Timurids and still other forces. However, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has finally defeated the Shirvanshahs in battle, and seized the capital of their country. Perhaps it is time to end the independence of the Shirvanshahs and begin the rise of a new Shia empire."
 annexation.21.a: "Shirvan is ours!"
 annexation.22.t: "The Fall of Constantinople"
 annexation.22.d: "Since the year 324, the city of Constantinople has served as the capital of the Roman Empire, becoming one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the entire world, facilitating trade and cultural interactions between Europe and Asia. Although it was defiled by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, it has remained a city of great wealth and splendor, holding a legendary and storied reputation.\n\nAt long last however, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has finally accomplished his long-held dream, which had never been achieved by any of his predecessors - the capture of the city of Constantinople. The walls of the great city have proven no match for Ottoman cannon, as Turkish soldiers and ships have surged over the metropolis’ fortifications and past the tremendous chain that once guarded the mouth of the Golden Horn.\n\nIt is a fatal strike at the former heart of Christendom, and it signals the rise of a new great empire to the east, which may one day surpass Rome entirely."
 annexation.22.a: "I am Kayser-i-Rûm!"
 annexation.23.t: "The Reconquest of Jaunpur"
 annexation.23.d: "In 1394, the Jaunpur Sultanate achieved its independence from the declining Delhi Sultanate. For decades, the Sharqi dynasty achieved mastery over the plains of the Ganges, establishing one of India’s wealthiest and most powerful kingdoms. However, the resurgence of the Delhi Sultanate, which had long been a rump state to the northwest, is now proving to be a death sentence to Jaunpuri independence. The armies of Delhi have captured Jaunpur, ending the history of one of India’s greatest states, but giving new life to an old empire."
 annexation.23.a: "Delhi is being restored."
 annexation.24.t: "The Capture of Multan"
 annexation.24.d: "This is not the first time a Timurid army has marched into the Indus Valley. Timur’s grandson Pir Muhammad first came to besiege the city in 1397, taking it after six months. The next year, Timur and the perfidious governor of Multan, Khizr Khan, would sack Delhi, and later, Khizr Khan would go on to found Delhi’s Sayyid dynasty. But now that Multan has fallen to Timurid forces again, it is perhaps time that we crown yet another new ruler of Delhi, who will be from a dynasty of our own making."
 annexation.24.a: "The road to Delhi is open."
 annexation.25.t: "The Conquest of Bengal"
 annexation.25.d: "The Bengal Sultanate is one of the richest and most prosperous kingdoms in the world, sitting at the mouth of the famous Ganges, the greatest of all Indian waterways. Bengal is renowned by merchants all over the world for the fertility of its plains and the productiveness of cities, which are the workshops of the world. Silk, ships, cotton, and all other manner of goods and wealth come from Bengal. Now, with our numerous military victories in the Delta, the Bengal Sultanate is faltering, and its cities are surrendering to us. In the Bengal Sultanate’s place, the empire of $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ will rise."
 annexation.25.a: "Bengal will be the heart of an empire."
 annexation.26.t: "The Conquest of Sindh"
 annexation.26.d: "In 1339, the Sammas of Sindh achieved independence from the Sultans of Delhi. Over the next century, Sindh would become one of the wealthiest kingdoms of India, as Thatta was increasingly graced by great works of Islamic architecture, and received trade from all corners of the Indian Ocean. However, in the time since then, the fortunes of Sindh have declined.\n\nNonetheless, our armies now have marched into Sindh, achieving a splendid victory. Many of the local nobility in Sindh wish to cooperate with us, and together we make Sindh an entrepôt for trade and culture once again."
 annexation.26.a: "We will restore Sindh to its former glory."
 annexation.27.t: "The Conquest of Gujarat"
 annexation.27.d: "The Gujarat Sultanate was one of the last kingdoms to break away from the control of Delhi, declaring its independence in 1407. But despite its youth, Gujarat rose to become one of the mightiest Indian kingdoms, controlling a powerful navy that rivaled even those of the Europeans, while receiving merchants from even the furthest lands of Africa and Asia. Nonetheless, the Sultanate has now grown decadent and feeble, unable to resist the strength of our armies. With Gujarat in our hands, even the upstart Europeans will have to take heed of our domination of India."
 annexation.27.a: "We will bring Gujarat more trade than ever before."
 annexation.28.t: "The Conquest of Malwa"
 annexation.28.d: "The Malwa Sultanate is one of many smaller successor states which broke away from the Delhi Sultanate in the wake of its decline in the second half of the 14th century. It is located at a strategic position in the center of India, and is known for its production of rare goods such as opium and saltpeter. Its ambitious monarchs have longed to gain control of Rajasthan and Gujarat, but their dreams will now have to come to an end, as they have suffered only defeat at the hands of our armies."
 annexation.28.a: "This will allow us to move south."
 annexation.29.t: "The Conquest of Kashmir"
 annexation.29.d: "Kashmir is the most powerful of all the kingdoms in the Himalayas, and is inhabited by people of many faiths, including Hindus, Muslims, and Buddhists. It has been often described as a mountain paradise, but now it must face the power of our mighty armies. The Kashmir Valley will become a pleasurable summertime resting place for our $MONARCHTITLE$s."
 annexation.29.a: "We have secured the north."
 annexation.30.d: "Although it once dominated most of India, the Delhi Sultanate has been in decline since the 14th century, having fractured into several smaller sultanates, each being ruled by a dynasty descended from Delhi’s former generals. Delhi barely survived the invasion of Timur, becoming a sordid rump state ruled by the traitorous Sayyid dynasty, who had helped Timur sack the city.\n\nHowever, regardless of its recent past, the city of Delhi still retains much of its older prestige as an imperial seat. The conquest of Delhi by an able and skilled monarch could signal the rise of a new great empire across the plains of northern India. As our armies enter the gates of Delhi today, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ wishes to be a contender for founding such a state."
 annexation.30.a: "We will be the new Sultans of Delhi!"
 annexation.31.t: "The Reconquest of Bengal"
 annexation.31.d: "The Bengal Sultanate is one of the richest and most prosperous kingdoms in the world, sitting at the mouth of the famous Ganges, the greatest of all Indian waterways. Bengal is renowned by merchants all over the world for the fertility of its plains and the productiveness of cities, which are the workshops of the world. Silk, ships, cotton, and all other manner of goods and wealth come from Bengal. While the previous Sultans of Delhi could not rein in the uproarious separatist leaders of Bengal, we shall surpass them in regard, and finally give a united administration to the region."
 annexation.31.a: "We welcome Bengal back to the fold."
 annexation.32.t: "The Reconquest of Multan"
 annexation.32.d: "The city of Multan was once an important western fortress of the Sultanate of Delhi, before it was overrun by the likes of Timur. Afterward, Khizr Khan, the traitorous governor of Multan, took over Delhi and established the Sayyid dynasty, bringing on a long period of decline to our nation. However, we have now recaptured Multan, and we will make sure to have a much tighter hold on the city than previous $MONARCH$s. We will not repeat the mistakes of the past again."
 annexation.32.a: "It is the gateway to India."
