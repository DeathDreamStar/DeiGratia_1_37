 string_start_aztecs: "From the early fourteenth century, the valley of §YMexico§! and its neighboring regions have labored under the sway of the rulers of the §YTepanec§! rulers of §YAzcapotzalco§!. Their reign, however, has faded. A bitter feud for the throne between the rival brothers Tayatzin and Maxtla left them vulnerable, and in 1428 they were overthrown by the nascent alliance between the city-states of §YMexico-Tenochtilan§!, §YTlacopan§! and §YTexcoco§!. Having now consolidated their power, this §YAztec§! triple alliance led by §YMontezuma Ilhuicamina§! now look to expand beyond their homes, in particular toward the wealth of the §YMixtec§! cities (such as §YCoixtlahuaca§!) to the south.\n\nEast of the Aztec, the allied city-states of §YTlaxcala§! are determined to maintain their independence in the face of Aztec aggression. The Aztecs are willing to accept it: Tlaxcalan captives taken in war to offer as sacrifice have far greater value to the empire than Tlaxcalan subjects. Meanwhile, to the south, the Nahuatl people of §YTeotitlan§! play the dangerous game of trying to maintain their independence through friendship with the Empire, rather than through warfare.\n\nTo the west, in the highlands of §YMichoacan§!, the cities of Lake Patzcuaro were unified between 1300 and 1350 under the rule of §YTariacuri of Tzintzuntzan§!. From this power, Tariacuri's §YPurépecha§! successors have spread further, creating a powerful state that can rival the Aztecs. Between them both Purépechas and Aztecs eye the §YMatlatzinca§! of the valley of §YTolluca§! warily: while they would make a nice addition to either empire, they may be more valuable as a buffer state, and aggression in that direction may well draw the two powers in a war they do not wish to fight.\n\nBut Tolluca is not the only worry of the Purépecha rulers. To the west and north of their realm, a plethora of small states like §YColima§!, §YTonalla§! and §YXalixco§! watch over wealthy saltpeter deposits that the Purépecha would like to control. Independently, they are unlikely to resist Purépecha expansion, but if they were to assist one another, they could be a formidable obstacle to Purépecha expansion.\n\nFinally, at the northern edge of the region, the various people that the Aztec collectively call §YChichimeca§! are a perennial source of problem for the more settled states to the south. The most powerful of them are likely the §YGuamar§! confederacy, but far more familiar to the Mesoamerican people are the §YOtomies§!, who are often settled among them, or found serving as mercenaries in countless wars."
 string_start_tag_central_america: "Recent years have seen the rise of the §YAztec§! triple alliance in the valley of Mexico, while the §YPurépecha§! empire has similarly started to expand their domain in the west.

The monasteries of Ethiopia are also the source of the education of the Ethiopian clergy, its nobility, and its administrators, as such contributing greatly to the revitalization of the Ethiopian Church in the years past.\nThe other side of this coin, however, is that the monasteries and the orders that run them have grown both rich and autonomous."

Perhaps there was once a practical need of bishops, clergy and spiritual guidance from abroad. The expansion of the Ethiopian Church over the last two centuries, however, means that our kingdom is now already training its own clergymen and there is a strong religious infrastructure in the form of churches and monasteries throughout or lands.\nWith the Egyptian Patriarchate held hostage by Muslim conquerors, we often have to wait a long time between the death of one bishop and the appointment of the next.

Ever since, these two great powers were at war with each other on several occasions with the Ethiopian-Adal war being the most prominent proxy war.\nAfter the small victory of Ethiopia, the Portuguese continued their wins against the Ottoman.

 string_start_bahmanis: "The sack of §YDelhi§! in 1398 was a monumental event for the subcontinent, but in §YBidar§! it did not have the impact it did elsewhere. The §YBahmani§! Sultans declared their independence from the north 50 years prior and had already built a new state in the dry Deccani upland. Rich in economic assets, among others the fabled diamond mines of Golconda, the Sultans are now wealthier than most kings. Their court, and its fabled Turquoise throne, is famous beyond the subcontinent. Fame that greatly helps to attract the greedy and gifted from the wider Muslim world.\n\nThe Bahmani Sultanate is also a troubled state. Cutting ties with the north has meant that it is without direct access to the west. At the same time the kingdom has a much smaller Muslim minority than most northern Sultanates and in its isolation even the most persianate of nobles have begun to adopt local culture and language. Newcomers and indigenized nobles often end up in conflict with each other and the new capital of Bidar has been built partly to avoid the intrigues of the old one in Gulbarga.\n\nNot far from the kingdom's southern border lies the City of Victory, §YVijayanagar§!. The city is the seat of the Sangama Rajas, and with its 400,000 inhabitants it is a very different place from the orderly fort city of Bidar. This is the capital of an Empire that stretches across Southern India and that has recently conquered almost the entire Tamil country in the far south. Vijayanagar is a formidable rival to Bahmani power, and has continued to advance on the contested zone between the two kingdoms. The seizure of the western Bahmani ports by agents of the Vijayanagara Empire is a strike right at the heart of the Sultanate's lifeline of immigration and imports.\n\nIn the east Kapilendra, founder of the Suryavansha dynasty of §YOrissa§!, has orchestrated the sudden rise of his kingdom as a military power. Striking at §YJaunpur§!, §YBengal§!, Vijayanagar and Bahmani interests at the same time the new king has in short time made a name for himself as a conqueror. Should he choose to turn his attention south, towards §YAndhra§! and §YTelingana§!, his actions may shake up the deadlock entirely."

 string_start_bengal: "The §YBengal§! Sultanate won its independence from the §YTughluq§! dynasty of §YDelhi§! in a long struggle of diplomacy, siegecraft, and warfare that lasted from 1354-1359. Bengal has established itself as a unified and powerful Sultanate over the last century.\n\nThe Sultanate's original §YIlyas Shahi§! dynasty been restored by Sultan Nasir-ud-Din Mahmud, a capable administrator and a man committed to upholding peace and stability. He has thus far presided over the development of Bengal's cities and the construction of magnificent new mosques.\n\nThe most pressing foreign threats facing Bengal are the §YGajapati§! Kingdom of §YOrissa§! and the §YSharqi§! dynasty of §YJaunpur§!. The Suryavanshas command the loyalty of the Garjat tribes, as they traditionally pledge their loyalty to whichever power controls the major coastal cities. If Bengal can defeat the Orissa kingdom, they might be convinced to extend that same loyalty to the Sultan. Like Bengal itself, the Jaunpur Sultanate broke free from the grip of Delhi, though it has enjoyed its independence only since 1393. Jaunpur controls a vast stretch of the Doab, the great riverine lands of the Ganges. Bengal and Jaunpur came to blows as recently as 1420. Though the conflict came to an abrupt end due to the intervention of Timurid and Ming envoys, many sore issues remain between both nations and further wars may be inevitable.\n\nRelations with the Buddhist Sultans of §YArakan§! have fluctuated wildly; in one year they are the Bengal’s loyal subjects, in another they are ambivalent allies, and in yet another they are a pirate menace. Future relations with Arakan are likely to be guided just as much by circumstance.\n\nBengal is a promising regional hegemon, with great potential for expansion. The Bengal tiger may yet become the sovereign of all India."
