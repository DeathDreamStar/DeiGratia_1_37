 flavor_daimyo.17.d: "The assassination of Shogun Ashikaga Yoshinori by the Akamatsu proved to be extremely profitable to the fortunes of the Yamana clan, not because we had taken issue with the Shogunate itself, but because we seized all the lands and belongings of the Akamatsu in the immediate aftermath. The Shogun has rewarded our loyalty by affirming the right of the Yamana to these newly captured lands, practically forgiving us for the Yamana-led rebellion against the Shogun in 1391.\n\nNonetheless, some clans continue to hold our rise to power in envy and suspicion. In particular, the Hosokawa clan, long one of the most powerful clans in Central Japan, has come to view our growing influence as especially troubling, and may act provocatively in order to place limits upon our ambitions in the near future."

 flavor_boh.1.d: "The Hussite wars technically ended in 1434, but the country was still divided, between those faithful to Rome, and those still loyal to the Hussite ideals. The leader of the Hussite party was Jirí z Podebrad, and after various attempts of reconciliation, he decided upon a military solution. He raised an armed force in northeastern Bohemia and seized Prague with little resistance. Civil War broke out though, as those faithful to Rome fought him, but eventually the Hussites won.\nHowever, Oldrich II z Rozmberka, a staunchly pro-Catholic noble, is also a viable alternative for the rulership of Bohemia. He has stated that he supports the claim of Ladislaus Postumus von Habsburg, the young, titular Duke of Austria and King of Hungary, to the Bohemian throne. Only under Rozmberka leadership can conflict with Rome be avoided. What shall we do?"

No English governor wants to be remembered as the one to surrender Maine, and in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], prominent nobles claim that our negotiatior, William de la Pole, had no mandate to make this concession in the first place.\n\nFrench emissaries have repeatedly tried to remind us of our obligations ever since the signing of the Treaty, and [FRA.Monarch.GetName] has finally taken matters into his own hands, showing up to the walls of Le Mans and demanding that the city surrender.\n\nUnless we surrender Maine to the French, we are likely looking at a hasty resumption of hostilities."

Nonetheless, the local commander shows no intention of opening the gates, despite not having a force strong enough to withstand an attack."

Though he would never reacquire the crown himself, René continued to style himself King of Naples throughout his entire life. With René now gone, the Anjou claims to Naples are looking increasingly inconsequential.\n\n[NAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [NAP.Monarch.GetName] of Naples is not without enemies however, and now [FRA.Monarch.GetName] has a chance to claim the Kingdom of Naples for himself. The Pope, increasingly incensed with [NAP.Monarch.GetName]’s refusal to pay feudal dues to the Papacy, has excommunicated [NAP.Monarch.GetName], declaring the throne of Naples effectively vacant.\n\nSeeking to reaffirm his spiritual authority over the whole of Italy, [PAP.Monarch.GetTitle] [PAP.Monarch.GetName] has invited [FRA.Monarch.GetName] to march his armies into Italy and claim the throne of Naples, hoping that this show of force backed by Papal authority will force other Italian states to at long last recognize Papal supremacy.\n\nWith the Neapolitan rulers becoming increasingly unpopular, using marriage ties between King René and our own dynasty as a pretext, we can enforce what would otherwise be [FRA.Monarch.GetName]’s very weak claim to the throne of Naples."

Tlalhuicole refused the monarch's generosity, demanding that he would undergo the same fate as the other prisoners. The Aztec monarch offered him the command of an army about to be sent to drive back the Purépecha, which Tlalhuicole accepted in the hopes of a glorious death in the ensuing battle. He defeated the Purépecha army despite their desperate resistance and returned to the Aztecs with spoils of war and many captives. Although the Aztec monarch tried to persuade Tlalhuicole he would not accept the place as commander-in-chief or return to Tlaxcala, as the first would be treason and the second a stain on his glory. Tlalhuicole got his wish, to be tied to the stone of the gladiators and sacrificed to the gods through battle. Eight warriors attacked Tlalhuicole, one after another, but they were all defeated.

On the beautiful autumn day of November 1, 1755, nearly everyone was in the churches celebrating the holidays when the ground suddenly began to shake and the churches started caving in, crushing the visitors. For those that escaped, it was far from over as a heavy breeze of wind suddenly started to come in over the area, beating the small fires into a virtual inferno incinerating thousands. But yet thousands more people would fall victim to the grand tidal wave reaching land a few minutes later. The death count was estimated to be 20,000 to 40,000 people at the time, and given all four elements’ involvement in the disaster (wind, fire, earth, and water), people largely rationalized the disaster as a punishment inflicted by God."
