 kapu_system: "Preserving the Kapu System"
 kapu_system_desc: "The Kapu system is the ancient Hawaiian system of laws which rule lifestyle, gender roles, religion, and the governing of the isles. The Kapu is a religious law, and enforces the will of the Gods upon the people. It also protects the holy sites of Hawaii and prevents the afforestation and plundering of our nation's precious resources for expedient pleasure. None are exempt from the Kapu; not commoners, not merchants, not foreign visitors, and not even the King."
 alii_nui: "Repurposing the Ali'i Nui"
 alii_nui_desc: "The Ali'i are the ruling class of Hawaii, and the Ali'i Nui is the individual who rules the ruling class. The Ali'i Nui were for a long time considered the highest members of society, with no individuals or institutions outranking them. With the unification of Hawaii, we cannot simply depose the old rulers of these regions, but rather we can redefine the meaning of Ali'i Nui into a secular position appointed by the King of Hawaii, solidifying our position without upsetting the Ali'i."
 hula_idea: "Hula"
 hula_idea_desc: "The Hula is a traditional dance often accompanied by an Oli Chant of a Mele Song. The Hula is more than a mere dance or performance, however. It is the medium by which we preserve our history, our culture, and tell stories of our ancestors and gods. The Oli or Mele describes the events as they happened with words, and the Hula translates those words into physical movement. The movement of our bodies and hands represent the literal words spoken or sung by the Oli and Mele, but also may represent the events of the story such as the flowing of the waves or the intense emotions of the legendary heroes of old."
 ohana: "Ohana"
 ohana_desc: "Ohana is the Hawaiian concept of family, and has long extended beyond mere blood relation. A family takes many forms, and adopted family is of equal importance to blood family. It was common practice for a great ruler to adopt trusted friends and allies into his or her family and treat them as kin, and our malleable concept of family makes Hawaiian society one which may welcome foreigners and strangers with brotherly arms."
 kanawai_mamalahoe: "Kanawai Mamalahoe"
 kanawai_mamalahoe_desc: "'Oh people, Honor thy god; respect alike people both great and humble; May everyone, from the old men and women to the children Be free to go forth and lie in the road Without fear of harm. Break this law, and die.' This is the Law of the Splintered Paddle laid out by King Kamehameha, and is the backbone of our society. The law is revolutionary and values the sanctity of all Human life, even that of our enemies, ensuring that the weak and innocent are protected from the devastation and hardships of war."
 naha_prophecy: "Naha Prophecy"
 naha_prophecy_desc: "The Naha Prophecy dictates that the man or woman who can lift the Naha Stone is the rightful ruler of all Polynesia.

 legendary_voyagers: "Legendary Voyagers"
 legendary_voyagers_desc: "The sheer number of ancestors across Polynesia who claim they originated from Hawaii are too many to count. It can't be denied that voyaging, exploration, and colonization is in the very blood of the Hawaiian people. We hear the open ocean calling us, and we obey. Using the ancient navigational techniques of following the migration of birds and the positions of the stars in the sky, we Hawaiians can venture to the edge of the Earth and back, bringing knowledge and riches back to the shores of our magnificent home."

 tonga_tangaloa_desc: "Tangaloa is a family of Gods of great importance to our people. The first member of the Tangaloa dynasty was Eiki; a cousin to the creator God Havea Hikule'o and the champion of Humanity: Maui. There are many stories of the exploits of the great Tangaloa family; including the hero Eitumapu'a who climbed a great ironwood tree into the skies and found the love of his life Ilaheva and slept beside her until the two islands Tala-kite and Mata-aho was forged from their love."
 tonga_pulotu: "Pulotu's Creation"
 tonga_pulotu_desc: "In the beginning, Pulotu pulled the great rock Touia'o Futuna from the infinite plane of ocean. On this new land emerged four sets of twins of opposite sexes, and each brother laid with his sister and their divine blood would produce four holy daughters. Our most ancient of ancestors bind all people together, and what better nation to keep the descendants of these people alive than the Tonga? Surely, our network of tributaries and subjects will understand that it is our brotherly and sisterly love of one-another that brings us closest to the ancient gods and ancestors."
 tonga_maui: "The Islands of Maui"
 tonga_maui_desc: "It is from Manuka in Samoa where Maui would receive his legendary fishing hook from none other than Tonga Fusifonua. When the great hero Maui went to fish in the ocean with this hook, he did not pull a fish from the ocean, but our home island of Tongatapu was dragged up from the bottom of the sea! As Maui continued to fish with this magical hook, he birthed ‘Eua and the many other smaller islands of our great kingdom, and even some of the isles of Fiji and Samoa as well. But it is Tongatapu, the capital island of our nation, that was the first of Maui's islands, and surely the divine nature of our land's birth that will attract even more merchants, settlers, and nobles to our shores."
 tonga_polynesian: "True Claimants to Polynesia"
 tonga_polynesian_desc: "While the other pacific Islanders embrace the winds of change as foreigners come to our shores, or indeed we come to foreign shores, we do not cave to the ways of others. As Tongans, we stand proud of our voyaging heritage, and remain as headstrong and resilient as a rock in the face of changing tides. We shall ensure our people continue to keep the Tongan identity alive."
 tonga_tongatapu: "The Bells of Tongatapu"
 tonga_tongatapu_desc: "We boast the highest ratio of people-to-temples in all the world. As one sails close to the shores of Tongatapu, among the whispering of the waves, one can hear the chime of bells and the gentle prayers of the faithful. Whether we choose to practice our old religion, or the emerging faiths from overseas, our faith shall bind us Tongans together, and everyone shall have a place to properly worship their gods."
 tonga_craftsman: "Ancient Tongan Craftsmanship"
 tonga_craftsman_desc: "We have an ancient tradition of bone carving, wood carving, and basket making. Our practices predates any records, and our great craftsmen have passed their trade down from generation to generation for so long that one could believe it is in our very blood."
 tonga_oceanic_empire: "The Oceanic Empire"
 tonga_oceanic_empire_desc: "Tonga is home to over 170 islands, with a people all connected by our ancient traditions and customs. Beyond that, the Tongan Empire collects its tributes from Samoa and Fiji, and many nations beyond our shores. With the brilliance and ingenuity we possess to keep a people unified across such an endless ocean, there is no nation better than the Tongan Empire to spread out across Oceania."

Music is a universal language all people understand, and it is with our mastery of the musical language that we shall find unity."
 samoa_faa: "Fa'a Samoa"
 samoa_faa_desc: "Fa'a Samoa is the ancient guideline for all Samoans on how to lead their lives, and how to rule their people.  The three structural elements of Fa'a Samoa liein the Matai or nobility, Aiga or family, and the clergy. There are over 18,000 noble families living on our various islands, and all follow the simple philosophy of Fa'a Samoa. It was by codifying what it means to be Samoan that we can maintain a kingdom that spans countless disparate islands across the sea."
 samoa_mauluulu: "Maulu'ulu"
 samoa_mauluulu_desc: "The Maulu'ulu is an ancient traditional dance practiced primarily by Samoan women, although many villages would have the men and women dance together. The dance is an artistic expression of everyday life in Samoa; imitating the motions of domestic duties, farming, fishing, and traditional customs. It is with this that we bind the activities of everyday life to our culture and make them transcendent."
 samoa_foreign: "Acceptance of the Foreign Missionaries"
 samoa_foreign_desc: "Although we wish to preserve our culture and heritage, it is irrefutable that these missionaries and prophets that come from overseas carry with them wisdom far beyond what we already possess. Perhaps by allowing them to stay and practice their ways, we may absorb some of that wisdom into our own society. A little western influence couldn't hurt. "
 samoa_tatau: "Tatau"
 samoa_tatau_desc: "The ancient art of the Tatau is practiced widely throughout the Polynesian Triangle. Master Tatau artists practice their craft with tools made from bones, tusk, teeth, shell, and wood. The process is long, arduous, and painful, but we do it to decorate our bodies with venerations to our ancestors and gods; showing a man's spirituality and commitment to the Samoan way of life."
 samoa_faavae: "Fa'avae I Le Atua Samoa"
 samoa_faavae_desc: "The religious practices of our people vary wildly in doctrine and denomination, but all are bound by the phrase “Samoa is founded on God”. It matters not what religion we practice, for it is Samoa itself which is holy among all gods. Sunday is a day of great rest for all Samoans, to worship their respective gods in the way they choose and spend time amongst their family. It matters not what faith you follow, for all are accepted in Fa'a Samoa."
 samoa_trade: "Polynesian Triangle Trade"
 samoa_trade_desc: "For years, Samoan traders have been involved in trading across the Polynesian Triangle; primarily with Fiji and Tonga, our close neighbours. Many societies would merely abandon the notion of trade across such a vast ocean, but our voyagers and traders understand the way of the waves better than any others. No matter the size of our nation, we shall remember the navigational techniques that brought riches to Samoa, and perhaps someday Samoa will reap the rich trade goods from all over the world…"

A potlatch is a highly complex event where we commemorate a specific event by gathering together; in them, usually the chief of the tribe would prove his own wealth by lavishly giving highly elaborate and expensive gifts to visiting people.

Such is the importance of the bison for our culture that we would feel guideless without them."

But best of all, they can be disassembled and packed away quickly, so they are perfect for when we need to relocate."

The number of mares and stallions are big among the tribes and they have become one with us. A part of our culture forever."
